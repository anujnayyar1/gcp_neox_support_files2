At first, it had all seemed spontaneous\u2014an innocent drive after school, a picnic along the river afterwards. Harmless enough. But though her eyelids now hung heavy, she still saw right through him. A little grass and then she'd just unzip her skirt... boys thought everything worked just like one plus one. \nWith a smirk, she took another puff before handing over the joint, and Pat took another toke.\n\\\"It looks like you had an accident,\\\" he said, brushing off the mud streaking her backside. She swatted him away and leaned back onto the blanket. \n\\\"It's all your fault.\\\" \n\\\"What did I do?\\\"\n\\\"You let go of my hand.\\\" \nHe winked a bloodshot eye and offered up the dying roach like a peace offering. Emma crossed her arms.\n\\\"Come on,\\\" he said. \\\"Don't be like that...\\\"\n\\\"My mouth is dry.\\\"\n\\\"I can fix that for you.\\\" \nHe drew her close for a chalky kiss, but she gave him her cheek instead. \n\\\"It's too weird,\\\" she lisped. \\\"You feel like... my brother or something.\\\"\n\\\"But you're an only child.\\\"\nEmma snorted, perching herself on the corner of the blanket, but the water seeped right through the quilt and her tweed skirt, forcing her back beside him. Patrick took it as an invitation to shotgun smoke into her mouth. \nShe puckered up and closed her eyes, trying not to laugh as their lips locked. She didn't want to push her luck. Six foot two and clean-cut, the star receiver of the Shrewsbury Colonials could easily land a loose cheerleader instead\u2014heck, any girl at Shrewsbury High would give her front teeth for a chance with The Patrick Murphy. But for some reason, he preferred a plain Jane with a speech impediment. Emma still wasn't sure why.\nHis French kiss was clumsy, and she pulled away, as the smoke hung in the humid air. And when he passed back the roach, she flicked it into the foamy reeds along the riverbank. \nPat gawked at her. \\\"What did you do that for?\\\"\n\\\"Come on Paddy, my mouth is drier than Lawrence of Arabia.\\\" \nShe wobbled to her feet, hacking her way through the thorns until she found the trail.\n\\\"A'right, a'right...\\\" he sighed, tossing the picnic blanket over his massive shoulder. \\\"But I have something to show you first. \\\"Don't worry you'll like it, I promise. Then we can head back, okay?\\\"\nShe raised her eyebrow. \\\"I guess. But not too far.\\\" \nEmma tied back her tangled brown hair and sighed as the sweat wicked from her neck. This year, the Indian Summer had stretched on through July and August, and, come September, the dog days weren't showing any sign of letting up. Last month she'd actually almost lopped all her hair off, but it would have made her look even more like her mother, she thought, and she reconsidered last-minute.\nThrough spiderwebs and stinging nettles, his long strides kept her at a canter, and as the trail wound uphill, the forest thickened. Her tongue stuck like clay to the roof of her mouth, and her saddle shoe snagged on a stray tree root, sending her tumbling forward into the mud again. He disappeared down a fork, and she called out to him, but his name came out only as a croak. \nShe finally found him surrounded in a cloud of mosquitoes just around the bend in a clearing of ferns. A concrete pillar towered ominously before him, and jutting out overhead, an uncompleted bridge terminated in a tangle of steel bars. The weed buzz made the entire structure seem to waver.\n\n\\\"God,\\\" she gasped. \\\"What is it, Paddy?\\\" \nHe placed his palm on the concrete pier. \\\"The new highway. My dad says it'll go all the way from The Bury to Worcester and then clear on to the Mass Pike.\\\"\nShe gazed across the clearing. The place seemed strangely familiar. \\\"Wait a minute. Have we been here before?\\\"\nWith a mischievous smile, Patrick pulled out his pocket knife and began hacking away at the undergrowth. Sure enough, buried in the brambles, lay their old oak tree. They followed the trunk up towards the branches, until they found their initials inscribed in the crude heart she'd carved into the bark two years ago when they first started dating.\n\\\"God,\\\" she said. \\\"You could see all the way downtown from that top branch. Remember?\\\"\nPat nodded, tilting his dimpled chin up toward the highway overpass again. \\\"I bet you can see a lot further from up there.\\\" \nHe pointed out a metal ladder, bolted to the backside of the column, and Emma followed it upwards with her eyes to a service platform just beneath the bridge. And without a second thought, Emma took hold of the lowest rung, scaling the first fifteen feet and then the first thirty as if it was just another old oak tree to be conquered. When she reached the platform, she turned the trapdoor over, hauling herself onto the walkway, and she lay there on her belly, peering down. The height combined with the lingering pot haze made her woozy. \nPatrick hung frozen, halfway up the ladder, and she taunted him as usual until his pride overcame his fear of heights.\n\\\"Come on scaredy-cat!\\\" she hollered. \\\"It's not so tall!\\\"\nWith a groan, he pressed on, and a minute later, he was squeezing his broad shoulders through the opening. And he refused her outstretched hand with a scowl and took the lead down the walkway. Cantilevering out overhead, massive I-beams made up the underside of the unfinished bridge, and from here, she could see that platform skirted the side of a concrete beam spanning to a second, identical column in the distance. \nAs they approached the end of the catwalk, the entire town spread out before them like an O-scale model. Up Prospect Street, the whitewashed clocktower of the First Congregational Church just broke through the tree line, downtown, the fluorescent sign above Belle's Diner flickered, and the gables above Ace Hardware, Perkins Groceries, and Eunice's Salon marched down Maple Ave. \n\\\"You can see way further than from that old tree, huh?\\\" he yelled over the wind. \\\"That must be Route 9 over there!\\\" \nEmma followed the black scar across the landscape. The state road connected Shrewsbury to Worcester\u2014her home. According to her gramps, the city had once been a powerhouse of industry, but these days, it was more urban sprawl than thriving metropolis.\n\\\"Look!\\\" she said, pointing to a splotch of blue and four black arches. \\\"You can even see Lake Quinsigamond, and Burn's Bridge too!\\\"\n\\\"Man, remember White City, Em? The Yankee Clipper sure scared the heck out of us as kids!\\\"\nEmma shook her head. She'd only heard rumors of the famous amusement park and its infamous rollercoaster. With a shrug, he pointed to a bare lot just beside the bridge. There was nothing there anymore. The freight train bayed in the distance, and they watched it wind around the lake, vanishing like an evaporating brush stroke where the water met the horizon. Pat put his hand on her shoulder. \n\\\"It's funny,\\\" he said. \\\"Sometimes you go back to a place you used to play as a kid, and it seems so much smaller than you remember?\\\"\nEmma nodded. \\\"My gramps's house felt like that... before he got his new condo in Florida.\\\"\n\\\"You think someday the whole Bury will be like that for us?\\\"\nShe sighed. Sure, Shrewsbury High was a cesspool of gossip and backbiting, but she'd grown attached to it. \\\"Give me that knife,\\\" she said, and he handed over his Swiss Army Knife with a reluctant look. She opened it using her only remaining fingernail and went at the side of the concrete beam with the blade, attempting to carve a heart. \n\n\n\n"}

So, I feel the need to write this down tonight. I have no idea why I feel compelled to do this, but I'm just going to roll with it because I obviously have no one to talk to.\nI need to get something off my chest. \nIt's something I've known my whole life. I've known it since my horrific early days at the Arctic facility called Imhullu. \nDumb name, I know. 'Imhullu' comes from the Babylonian creation myth called En\u016bma Eli\u0161 in which the evil goddess Tiamat was defeated using a weapon named Imhullu. Who knew mad scientists had poetic streaks and interests in ancient mythology which they used when naming their state-of-the-art murderer making factory? Imhullu was the place where I was beaten and experimented on and forced to fight and\u2014\nShit. I'm getting distracted. \nStupid two for one cocktail night.\nAnyway, monsters are real. \nThat's what I wanted to write down, what I need to get off my chest. For centuries, humanity has fought these evils in secret. The government has always surreptitiously funneled money into researching and combating the terrors of the night: lycanthropes, other shapeshifters, vampires, witches... even goddamn demons. All of Tiamat's original eleven species of creatures are real, and there are hundreds of other monsters too. Humans often call them cryptids or ghosts or aliens or whatever. Few people realize their tax dollars actually go to fighting these evils, and while relatively normal people are busy obsessing over places like Area 51, the real shit goes down above the Arctic Circle at Imhullu.\nThat's where my first home was. Imhullu. \nTo fight these monsters, my siblings and I were genetically engineered and trained to hunt from the time we could walk. We weren't born. We were grown in artificial wombs. \n\\\"You don't birth weapons. You make them.\\\" \nAt least, that's what our handlers told us. Love was weakness. Kindness was weakness. Weapons don't worry about ethics or morality or kindness or love. Weapons just maim and kill, as we were trained to do. The enemies would show us no mercy, so we shouldn't show them any either. To dehumanize us, we children at Imhullu were given no names, only numbers representing our place in the production sequence and a letter corresponding with our genetic model. They said that we engineered children, called Hunters, were neither Marduk, the divine savior of the world and creator of humanity, nor Lullu, the human savior from the creation myth. \nWe were simply Imhullu, the weapon used to defeat Tiamat and her monsters. We were constructed to play a very important role in this myth, but we were also objects, tools employed to fight the darkness. Defective, useless objects are always cast aside because in the great battle of humanity versus the monsters, faulty weapons couldn't be trusted. \nSo, at Imhullu, defective children were thrown away... scrapped... killed. \nI guess normal people would say Imhullu's defective kids were killed, though my brother 08A wasn't defective. He was the best. Zero Eight Alpha was Imhullu's most efficient killer and most loyal and trusted soldier... \nUntil he turned on them and helped me escape, saying something about how Imhullu was sucking away my humanity and compassion and turning me into a monster before he ushered me into the plane that would carry me away from that horrific facility. My brother gave his life for mine. \nI miss my brother. \nI miss Pop. He took me in once I escaped and\u2014 \nDamn. I made myself sad. Hang on. I need to grab a napkin so I don't ruin this cheap ass paper. And, why in the hell are these tiny little rectangular napkins so awful. They can't absorb anything. Anyway, crisis averted. \nWhere was I? Oh yeah. \nDiary. \nSorry! This diary entry wasn't supposed to be about my sob story. This is only about how monsters are real and how people should wake up and realize that fact. Monsters are evil but so is the Imhullu Project, which the humans run. Humans have been using child soldiers and murdering with wanton abandon. And so have the monsters.\nSo yeah... that's about it.\n Everyone is garbage, and monsters are real. You should trust no one and repent if you believe in higher powers because either Imhullu or the monsters will win this war, and normal people don't want either of those bad guys to win. \nOn second thought, don't repent if you don't want to. I don't give a shit.\nOh! What I do give a shit about is money. I need is a job. \nI need money. Otherwise, I can't afford more whiskey and French fries. Ah, hell. I got ketchup on my notebook. I guess that's a sign that I should shut up and finish my fries. \nBye.\nXoxo\nMeri\n\nChapter 2\n\nSighing, I snapped my little notebook closed and returned it to my inside coat pocket then took a sip of my bourbon and cast my eyes about the sleazy bar. The place was packed to the gills with local types, the kinds of guys who wore flannel and work boots and worked hard in the day and spent their nights getting drunk and regaling each other with tales of their adventures and sexual conquests. I ignored the sounds of the jukebox and smell of alcohol and unwashed drunks as I took in my surroundings with a practiced eye. \nWhen I was a child, they taught us that everyone was a potential enemy. When we would go into the field for the first time, they said we would be overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of the ignorant human masses who had no clue that there were evils in this world waiting to prey on them. And we were training so that we could kill those evils before they killed the innocents. If we wouldn't fulfill that purpose, then we were useless. That was what they'd often tell us when one child at Imhullu died in combat or was taken for 'reeducation' never to be seen or heard from again. \nI shuddered at the memory before taking another sip of my beer. I wasn't at Imhullu anymore. I'd left it eleven years ago when my brother had saved me from that horror, giving his life so that I could escape the Arctic facility. Then the kindly old man had taken me in and sheltered me from the people training to hunt me down. Pop taught me right from wrong. He taught me that what they'd done to me was brainwashing, that no kid should ever have witnessed the horrors that I had. Pop had even given me my name, my actual name, not the name 30B that the Imhullu Project had assigned to me. He'd given me the name Meriwa. It was 'thorn' in Inuit... \nBut sometimes I had those dark moments when I thought none of that good stuff mattered. \nBecause Pop was still dead, and so was my brother.\nAnd I was alone, flitting from bar to bar and hoping to find some sort of purpose. But what reason was there for me to even try to find meaning in this world. Me... a genetically engineered monster hunter with no monsters to hunt. \nThe sound of someone breaking a triangle of pool balls with the cue ball helped distract me from these thoughts, and that's when my attention was drawn to a woman speaking loudly into a cell phone from a table in the corner. She didn't fit in here, her smart but sensible suit standing out like a sore thumb against the sea of flannel and Carhart jackets.\nShe also stood out because she was angry, raising her voice into the phone. \\\"The guy refused to do the work on the car until tomorrow. I'm stuck spending the night in some shitty motel in the middle of nowhere. Anyway, I'll at least make it back to New Orleans by 3:00 tomorrow.\\\"\nAs she spoke, two local men clad in work boots and dark flannel shirts walked up to her table, and I observed the interaction curiously. The two figures had lust in their eyes, but I was convinced the woman didn't know that as she put one manicured hand over the phone's microphone and addressed them. \\\"Can I help you?\\\"\n\n\nThe guy nearest her spoke with a slightly drunken drawl, leaning forward in a way that already had the woman flinching away from him with discomfort. \\\"We've been listening to you tell that person on the phone how much you disliked our town. We'd like to buy you a drink, show you how great this place really is.\\\"\nSighing, she held up her wineglass for emphasis as she spoke. \\\"I'm good, thanks. I don't need another drink.\\\" She attempted to return to her phone call, but the guys refused to return to their seats at the bar, choosing instead to remain standing near her table.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nThe Den: Thomas, a ten year old boy, goes to buy something from Oscar AKA the Fixer. Oscar\u2019s den is dark and mysterious. Thomas is scared but trying to hide it, he then notices four coloured vials.\n\n#super-power #sciencefiction, #mysterious,  #scifi, #sci-fi, #adventure #fantasy\n\nThe Den\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\n\\\"Stop wastin' my time,\\\" he said. \nHis words snapped at the boy like angry dogs, chained to a fence but straining for purchase at the throat of their intended victim. His eyes watched him, their curious stare not sharing the bite of the voice. The dark pupils had a thin rim of angry red, adrift on an anaemic sea of not quite white. \nWhatever the light shining in them, they never changed. The pupils didn't dilate at night or contract to pin pricks when the sun hit its high point. They were fixed spheres that offered and took nothing. They simply watched and waited. \n\\\"I'm not wasting your time,\\\" Thomas said. \nHe knew Oscar Sovaris, also known as (or AKA, an acronym Thomas had learned three years before and thought too cool not to use) the Fixer, was playing with him. The man would allow any amount of time to pass if it meant a sale. He'd push, sometimes letting his words free of their leash, but he was harmless really. \nAt least if you bought something. If you left without making a purchase, you were at risk of waking up to find you were missing a limb. Or worse. \nThere'd be no proof other than mounting coincidence, but you knew. So you went to see Oscar knowing what you wanted. Any time spent over and above the actual transaction, was taken up with haggling the price or choosing from his wide range of variations. Whatever you wanted, Oscar had at least a dozen options to select from. But no sale meant you were leaving with the knowledge of who and what he was. You could talk. If you'd bought, however, you were incriminated also.\n\\\"You ain't pickin' yer nose eiver, but either way, I'm not gettin' no money.\\\" \n\\\"I'm just unsure. I was told you were the man who can. It has to be right.\\\" \n\\\"Oh, I'm sure it does. But I ain't got all day.\\\" \nThat was a lie. Oscar had nowhere to go. His agoraphobia kept him contained in his shack, with his sales his only interaction with other people. Once Thomas had left, there would be a short period where Oscar sat and watched his reflection in the only mirror he owned (and the only item he refused to sell). \nHe envied his reflection. It could go wherever it wished, and did so frequently. Oscar had become a voyeur in the life his mirror self had, but was refused him. Once upon a time, he revelled in it. He enjoyed and prompted the trips to other rooms. Other mirrors. Other people's lives. In doing so he became a hermit while his reflection became dominant. \nNow, he could only watch and wish. \nThomas didn't know that. To Thomas, Oscar was a man to be respected and, in no small measure, feared. To a certain extent, even envied. The assumed life of the Fixer, was one of wealth. Of a vast web of helpers. Of women desperate to please, in any way they were asked. Of others so eager to please and be a part of his entourage, they would do anything. \nOscar knew this and let the legend grow. The web existed. The list of people glad to do his bidding almost inexhaustible. But they were not friends. They each believed the lie and, for Oscar, it was all he needed. Even though his reflection didn't listen to his requests, and too many times ignore the man that gave it substance, it still helped him when it felt amenable. For Oscar to be in the position he was, was useful. To be in that position required information. To get said information, one had to be able to go where no one else could. Into the hidden lives of influential folk. Their bedrooms. Their meeting rooms. \nAny and all of the places a mirror could hang. \nThomas was afraid. He guessed that the Fixer could tell. There were no outward signs of sweat or trembling. His voice didn't waver or stumble over its words. But this was the Fixer. He knew everything, so he surely knew that.\n\nOscar didn't, but guessed. A ten year old boy, walking into the den of someone with his reputation, and reputation was everything regardless of the truth, would be stupid if not scared. Fear was an emotion that kept you alive. It was the body's way of telling you to be careful. To run and hide. It should be listened to. \nThomas needed something, however, and the Fixer was the only person who could possibly get it. \nThe light hung low in the shabby back room. Its glow was dim, sharing only a portion of its potential with the occupants. It flickered, as if to tell the pair that they were lucky it could manage this. The room was dirty and cluttered. Dust coated everything with a layer of grey that dragged your mood down into the shadows occupying all corners. Where there was paper on the walls, it was stained and peeling. Patchy. Faded. Where there was none, the bare plaster was cracker or chipped or missing entirely? Bare brick peeked through, thankful to be uncovered, if only in parts. \nWhy would the bulb wish to reveal all that? \nThomas's blindfold, a mandatory fashion accessory if you wished to do business with the Fixer, hung around his neck. He tugged at it, hoping his fear would be wiped away and he'd be able to act like the grown up he so wished he was. The fear didn't want to leave him, though. It liked oozing from his every word and mannerism. The blindfold was a blocker, as was the grubby dome sitting between them. The former prevented the wearer from using any form of GPS technology to trace their whereabouts. The latter prevented anyone from finding the Fixer's lair. \nBoth were outdated models, superseded three times over, but they did the trick. Oscar didn't believe in upgrading unless absolutely necessary. The blockers kept his location and that of his treasures a secret. His customers would go to random locations, found after a series of clues. They would be met by his only real companion, his dog, Ridley. The canine knew every passageway and dark alley in the city, and led the customer along them in a meandering path. Only, though, after they donned the blindfold. Any attempt to see beneath it or refuse to wear it was met with sharp teeth and a deep bite. Ridley, a King Charles, Chihuahua Cross, might look like a calm, friendly hound - and usually that's exactly what he was - but he could turn in a second. \nIf the potential customer was either the police, such as there still were such a force, or a competitor trying to rid themselves of someone much more successful, Ridley would know. His nose was keen. He could smell a lie. He could see it in a look or a stance. He was never wrong. \n In such cases, his attack was swift. If attacking was not the best option, with the customer having a power that could best him, Ridley simply left. He would go along those discreet pathways until he was sure he wasn't being followed, and then return to his owner. He'd do so even if it took days. A month and a half in one extreme case. \nThe table they leaned on was unsteady on its feet. One leg was slightly shorter than the others, a deliberate measure designed to set the customer off balance. It would distract their focus, given them something to be frustrated with, as every movement made wobbled the table. And Oscar was sure to make as many movements as he could, to the point he sometimes appeared to have a twitch. \nThere were four vials on the table. Two filled with a red liquid, one blue and one green. The red ones had dark particles floating slowly through them. The blue was pale, the colour of an early summer morning, with black spots appearing and disappearing so quickly it was difficult to look at one before it was gone. You only really saw them when you looked at the container as a whole rather than more closely. The green vial's contents were a vibrant jade. It was a solid colour, unspoiled by foreign bodies floating inside, and it seemed to glow when you looked at it, a glow that stopped when your eyes were diverted. \n\n\n\n\n"}

I'm tempted to start knocking but that might spook her and she's already so easily scared. \nThe first time I ever climbed into her window, she knew I was on the way and she still screamed bloody murder when I showed up knocking.\nThat was three years ago. I would have started coming up here sooner but I had to wait until I was tall enough to reach the wonky, extended brick under her window that happens to serve as the last perfect foothold into her bedroom. It turns out, I didn't get that kind of height until I was thirteen.\n\\\"Vera!\\\"\nNothing.\nIf she would just stop locking this window at the halfway point with those fancy latch things, I'd be able to open it the rest of the way and squeeze in but her parents gets weird about that. Probably because there's currently a sixteen year old boy trying to get into their daughter's room after midnight but that's neither here nor there.\nShe's not expecting me. I wasn't supposed to be back from football camp until tomorrow morning but I convinced Mom to come get me sooner. I couldn't wait any longer.\nThe girl on the other side of this window is the reason for that but I don't dare mention that to my parents. Dad would get pissed and I'm not in the mood for another fight. As for Mom, she already knows I've got a thing for the girl four houses up.\nOkay, I'm going in for the knock.\nEver so gently.\nShe jolts awake, her eyes as wide as the Grand Canyon. As bad as I feel for waking her up in a fright, I'll never miss that look on her face. She's made the same face since she was five years old. I mean it, there's even photographic evidence of it. Although, I don't need photos to remember it. I know her face like the back of my hand. \nThat's what old people say, right? When you know something really well? That's how I feel about Vera Valentine. I know her like the back of my hand. \nShe's been my friend for as long as I can remember. Our parents were friends and their parents were friends. So, you could say our friendship is a generational blessing. We didn't meet until we were five though. My parents left this little hometown of theirs in upstate New York when they went to college. \nThey lived in California, got married there, and had me. We lived there until I was five, before coming back here to Oakwood. They reunited with their old friends who happened to live on the street where they found the perfect starter home and, what do ya know, they had also had a five year old. We were even born just a few days apart from each other one cold January day. Well, cold for Vera. I was in California. \nThe rest is history. Every memory of mine includes her. At least all the ones worth remembering.\nLike this face. The one coming at me right now. The one I know like the back of my hand. \nThere has got to be a better way of saying that.\n\\\"Colten?\\\" Her voice is all cute and gravelly, irritated and sweet. Just like the face, I never miss that tone when she's been woken up against her will. The one where she's really pissed but too nice to actually be mean.\nVera's a sweetheart, sweet like candy. It's no wonder her last name is Valentine. She's everything people love. A cup of hot cocoa when you've spent the whole day sledding on a fresh blanket of snow or a glass of ice cold lemonade when it's hot as shit outside.\n\nShe's a game winning touchdown pass, a perfect haircut, a really good day at school. She's just... the ideal moment, the epitome of happiness.\nI put on my best smile for her. \\\"Who else would be trying to get into your window at this hour?\\\"\nShe sighs, clicking the locks up and pushing the window the rest of the way open. \\\"Would you hurry before someone hears you? How long have you been out there?\\\"\nWow, she's way better at whisper shouting than I am.\nI tumble into her room in the most graceful, quiet way so that she won't kill me. She's way too serious about the rules. She bends them for me but she also hates being grounded and I've been the reason she got grounded just one too many times now. \n\nVera turns on her lamp, a soft glow illuminates this room I know so well. I take a quick look around to see if anything changed over the summer, thankfully finding nothing out of the ordinary. The place is a mess. Same old Vera. I'm probably looking at the same stack of papers on her desk from when school ended and that's definitely the same hoodie stuffed onto her bookshelf. \nShe turns to me, wipes the sleep away from her eyes with the back of her hand, squinting as they adjust to the light. And then, she smiles and I almost topple over. The best part about her is her smile.\nAs she makes her way to me, I make my way to her. We're drawn together like a magnetic force. We go together like macaroni and cheese or mashed potatoes and gravy. No, not mashed potatoes. She hates mashed potatoes. Maybe bread and butter. \nYeah, I like that better. That's us. Fresh baked bread and butter melted all over it.\nShit, now I'm hungry.\nWhen she wraps her arms around me, my whole body feels foreign but in a good way. It's so strange. It didn't used to be like this. Nope, this is new. But I think I like it. \nIf I had to pin down a time to say when it happened, I would have to guess sometime this past spring. I've always felt something for her. But a few months ago, it stopped feeling the same as it always had when I made contact with her skin. For all the times we'd touched, snuggled on the couch, slept beside each other over the years, all the playful wrestling and casual hand holding, it suddenly started feeling... different.\nIt's not her. Well, it sort of is but only in the best of ways. It's mostly all me. The way my body feels when I look at her, my heart seeming to jump in my chest without permission. How whenever she smiles or sings or talks or... well, really does anything with her mouth, I'm completely mesmerized, can't peel my eyes from her. \nSometimes, when she says something, I'll feel it in my stomach and I'm pretty sure that's not supposed to happen. But with Vera, it does.\nThere's also the matter of the raging hard-ons. But that's not really new. Just new with her. It's all new with her.\nVera stuffs her face into my chest and I smile when I feel her deep inhale against my shirt. I love when she does that because I like how she smells, too. It makes me feel less like a psychopath for all the times I've tried to catch a whiff of her hair or lingered too long on a hug to smell her neck.\n\\\"I missed you,\\\" she mutters. \nMy arms wrap around her a little tighter, stopping only before I think she might suffocate. I just can't get close enough to her. But killing her on accident from a super hug would be sort of devastating. What a way to go though.\n\n\\\"I missed you more,\\\" I tell her.\nShe looks up at me, her gigantic green eyes shining. \\\"When did you get back?\\\"\n\\\"Just now. I came straight over.\\\"\n\\\"Straight here?\\\"\n\\\"Straight here.\\\"\n\\\"You must have known I was thinking about you.\\\"\nI had a feeling. \nShe's still holding me captive with her eyes and, all of a sudden, it's like we're ten years old again. She's hopping out of the car after visiting relatives for five days in North Carolina. I wasn't sure when they were expected home but I couldn't get her off my mind. Something made me start walking to her house, where I sat on the porch for all of five minutes before they pulled up, Vera's bright smile beaming at me. \nI was just thinking about you! she'd said, before tackling me to the ground in a hug.\nWe're always thinking about each other.\n\n\n\n"}

She was already donning comfier, plane worthy clothes. \\\"Potentially not. And technically, he's moving you back across the ocean.\\\" \n \\\"It doesn't count,\\\" Tatum said with a huff, blowing a lock of brown hair from her face. \\\"You're mad to be willing to move to Indiana.\\\"\n \\\"I don't imagine it will be so bad, T,\\\" Elena offered, low loafers absently kicking the suitcase at her feet. \\\"It could be fun to go somewhere new. I've never been to America, and you don't remember much of it. Not to mention he timed it to where you won't lose any time with school. You'll start a brand-new year with all your other classmates.\\\"\n \\\"Ladies, a hand?\\\" Jordan, nearly finished with removing all of the luggage, nodded toward their bags for the long plane ride before angling a thumb toward the door. \\\"We're nearly ready.\\\"\n As if she hadn't heard her father in the first place, Tatum flailed a hand in the air. \\\"The American schooling system barely lines up with ours. None of the classes will be in the right place. I'll either already have taken it or be entirely lost on the subject. And they don't even use the metric system like the rest of the planet.\\\" \n \\\"It's only one year.\\\" Elena picked up her purse from the carpeted floor of the empty living room, it stocked full of reading material and snacks. \\\"Senior year is a big deal in America. You can feed into that. School spirit or whatever they call it.\\\"\n \\\"Elena, do you really picture me as the school spirit type?\\\" Tatum asked with quirked brow, almost grinning as she grabbed her own backpack and hauled it over her shoulder. \n Elena laughed, flicking the collar of her stepdaughter's leather jacket. \\\"No, Tate, you don't. But you might like getting out of your comfort zone. You might even like Indiana.\\\"\n \\\"Ladies, please. We have a flight to catch.\\\"\n \\\"You have all the tapes you want to listen to?\\\" Elena asked as the pair of brunettes walked out of their well-loved home just shy of the Welsh border into the timid summer air. \n \\\"I sure hope so.\\\" Tatum slid into the back seat of the black cab parked just shy of the 'For Sale' sign stuck in the front garden. \\\"I'm out of luck if not.\\\"\n Elena grinned as she joined her in the back, letting Jordan shut them inside. \\\"I think I have a few extra pounds if you want to watch the film, just in case.\\\"\n Almost ignoring the sounds of the boot shutting and Jordan climbing in the cab, Tatum only shook her head, giving a light scoff. \\\"And watch Flashdance for the fiftieth time? I'll just chew gum to entertain myself.\\\" \n \\\"Hey, it's a good movie.\\\"\n \\\"It is, but I've also seen it more times than I can count. You always put it in for bid on movie night.\\\"\n Jordan glanced over his shoulder as the cab backed out of the driveway, nudging his way into the conversation. \\\"I thought I read they were playing Risky Business this month on international flights.\\\"\n Tatum's face lit up, grinning wide. \\\"Oh, god I hope so. Tom Cruise is a dream.\\\"\n \\\"He's from America,\\\" the driver offered. \\\"Maybe you'll meet them.\\\"\n \\\"In Indiana?\\\" Tatum laughed. \\\"I highly doubt that. I doubt anyone more famous than Dad has stepped foot in Hawkins.\\\"\n The cab driver's brow quirked. \\\"Hawkins?\\\"\n\n\\\"My sentiments exactly.\\\"\n\\\"Why is there so much corn?\\\" \n \\\"Because they grow a lot of corn here, Tate.\\\"\n Tatum pressed her forehead to the glass of their musty rental car, eyes sunken in from a rogue sleep pattern and her glorious mane flatter than usual. \\\"What a response, Dad. How's that Bram Stoker award treating you?\\\"\n \\\"How did you expect me to answer that question?\\\" Jordan asked from the front seat, perfectly comfortable despite being on the opposite side than normal. \\\"There's a lot of corn because they grow a lot of corn. We'll be out of it soon, anyhow. Hawkins doesn't have much cropland nearby.\\\" \n \\\"Did you get a lot of writing done on the plane?\\\" she asked through a light huff, dead Walkman lying next to her with its headphones messily draped over. \n Jordan hummed an affirming noise, nodding. \\\"I ran through a whole pen, actually,\\\" he replied. \\\"I think it'll be a good one.\\\"\n \\\"Do I get a pitch?\\\"\n \\\"Not this time, love. I'll keep it close to my chest for a while.\\\"\n Tatum playfully pursed her lips, keeping her voice low in hopes of letting Elena keep sleeping in the passenger's seat. \\\"You said that with your last novel and then spilled the whole plot over dinner the next night.\\\"\n Jordan laughed softly, driving with one hand while taking a sip of to-go coffee from the gas station they stopped at just outside of metro Chicago. \\\"I think I'll play this one a little more low-key.\\\"\n One of the most interesting dynamics of the Rivers family was how they spoke as a whole. Jordan, raised in the states and emigrating as a fully-fledged adult, even over a decade of living in England didn't take his American accent away, albeit adapting a few words here and there. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 His wife, a native Brit who'd only just set foot on American soil not two hours before, spoke with a full English accent. Being married to an American had given her a few phrases here and there that would get her strange looks from other friends but was otherwise uninfluenced. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 His daughter, however, born in America, had long forgotten ever speaking without an English accent. She hadn't even started school when they moved overseas, thus years of British public schooling and a constant presence of her English stepmother rendered her blended entirely into the accent. Her school friends had even stopped calling her 'the American' by the time she was seven.\n So naturally it made sense to remove her from a comfortable environment and send her back to the United States where she would stick out like a sore thumb.\n \\\"Do you want to talk bikes?\\\"\n Tatum's head lifted from the window glass, tired eyes widening. \\\"Yes. Yes, absolutely.\\\"\n \\\"What are you thinking? Did you do that research like you said?\\\" Jordan asked.\n Tatum took a deep breath, nodding. \\\"A Kawasaki Ninja with cherry red detailing.\\\"\n Jordan's brow quirked to her quick response. \\\"What year?\\\"\n \\\"1984.\\\"\n \\\"You want this year's bike? Brand new?\\\"\n \\\"They're not as much as you would think,\\\" Tatum defended eagerly. \\\"They're really well priced for the market. There's even a few dealers not too far from Hawkins.\\\"\n Jordan hummed in thought for a moment, road still roaring underneath them. \\\"Have you considered any American bikes? Maybe in the spirit of moving to a new country?\\\"\n\n\\\"Do you know how well the Japanese bikes are made? This one has the best lean capability of all the ones released this year across the board. It's unmatched.\\\"\n \\\"You know,\\\" Jordan sighed, \\\"for a long time I thought you were going to be a complete nerd. Always reading and getting good grades.\\\"\n Tatum arched an amused brow. \\\"And then?\\\"\n \\\"And then you wanted your first Vespa, your addiction to Queen started and let's not forget the leather. God, the leather.\\\"\n \\\"No, let's forget the leather,\\\" she replied, glancing to her jacket discarded in the seat next to her as soon as they stepped outside of the air-conditioned airport. \\\"At least for now.\\\"\n \\\"All I'm saying is that you went for cool girl status,\\\" Jordan told her. He switched out his coffee for an unlit cigarette, leaving it between his lips for a moment as he pressed in the car's lighter. \\\"And it makes me nervous.\\\" \n \\\"Can I have one?\\\" \n Jordan used the car lighter on the end of his cigarette, taking in a deep breath to start the burn. \\\"Not with Elena in the car.\\\" He mumbled excitedly after a moment, sliding the cigarette to the corner of his mouth as he pointed out the window, the corn field dissipating as they drove further. \\\"Look, that mountain's just outside of town. We're getting close.\\\" \n\n\n\n"}

Fourteen years and counting.\u00a0\nThe first time we met, we were two stubborn daycare kids with scuffed knees and missing teeth. Kids that breathed in horseplay and chaos. First time my eyes met Will's, we were standing across from each other, centered in the middle of the neighborhood playground, flip flops pressing into the pebbles, gazes inquisitive.\nOur first encounter is a muddled mess, disappearing into the plethora of all our other memories and what not. However, I have a vague idea of what went down that Saturday, at exactly 0900.\nI'm guessing it was something along the lines of a little blonde kid playing in the sandbox on a hot summer day. Maybe a zoom-in to his sweaty face, suffering under the unrelenting Californian heat.\nThen, enter stage left: A little curly haired kid walks up to him.\nLittle blond kid looks up and asks curly haired kid if he wants to search for seashells with him.\nThe offer is accepted, and the two kids\u00a0essentially start searching for seashells in the sandbox every single day.\n(They never find the seashells, but I digress)\nExit stage left: the two toddler kids walk out as best friends, conjuring the tumbling hurricane, of Will and I and giving birth to a strange fucking friendship. Nothing remarkable, but nothing mundane either.\nA tale of how a friendship was born.\nDefinitely a moving story.\u00a0\nWith the stars emanating from his eyes, Will always eagerly shares the story, the words slipping from his lips like honey. There's a crinkle in his eyes, amusement that shines so bright, captivation isn't an option when listening to him.\nIt's a necessity.\nChildhood stories aside, my aforementioned best friend is still a dumbass.\u00a0\nHe's laughing. Always laughing. Stupid shit, irritating shit. Amusing shit. To him, at least. He's the one that continues to laugh long after the joke has returned to the atmosphere. He's the one that commands attention with that laugh.\nRight now, messy hair that he refuses to cut fall in front of his eyes, head pressed against my shoulder, grin wide, eyes flickering up to mine.\nHis eyes are doing that crinkling thing again, the lighting catching wisps of his irises as though this moment is his.\u00a0\nMy look remains blank, but he's practically cackling now, showcasing his pearly whites, and my lips quirk upwards, because it's hard not to laugh when he is.\n\\\"Comedic gold,\\\" I let the comment slide out dryly.\nWill's grin screams stars. \\\"No lies detected.\\\" A pause. His lip quirking upwards. \\\"Asshat.\\\"\n\nGusts of air escape my lips, a half grin refusing to stop painting my face in shades of sun.\u00a0\nWill leans his head on my laps, and I half heartedly try to push him off despite the fact that he's being doing it for years. Over 14 years to be exact. He throws his legs over the edge of the couch, head still resting on one of my legs.\u00a0\n\\\"I hate you,\\\" I decide, making no move to remove his head that's pressed against my arm. The wisps of hair that press against it. My eyes flicker over to him, daringly.\u00a0\n\\\"You know you love me,\\\" his expression is blank, eyebrows raised, faint shadow smile fighting to appear on his lips, phone in hand. It\u2019s cover is gray, some garage sale stickers lazily plastered onto it.\u00a0\n\\\"We'll go with that,\\\" I say, nodding, lips pursed. There's a parting of Will's lips in faux offense, the curling of his nose.\n\\\"Shut the fuck up,\\\" he says, but he's grinning again, and I find my back pressing against the couch, my lips pursed.\nThe movie starts playing. Same weekend on repeat. Sweet nostalgia clings at my chest. Nostalgia that never truly went away. After all, for fourteen years and counting, shit has always stayed the same. Weekends have always stayed constant.\nWe've always stayed constant. Same scene every Saturday night.\nJust the two of us watching movies, and my occasional groaning at Will's running commentary throughout the entire movie, which usually consists of some shade directed towards a character's clothing choice, or shade directed towards their dry humor.\n\\\"Something's going on at Maddy's tonight,\\\" his grin is tilted, lips pursed, eyes flashing with thought.\nSaturdays belong to Maddy Wilson. Have for as long as I can remember.\n\u00a0The rest of us merely bask in her aura. While I don't have a problem with that, I'd rather stay in, wrapped up in a blanket burrito.\u00a0\nA scene where my classmates are up against each other, screaming the night away as deafening music fills the atmosphere isn't exactly my shit.\nWill, however, basks in the atmosphere. He thrives, he inhales, he lives. Everything about parties that suck the energy straight out of my chest, seems to only increase that vibrant power he radiates. He grows underneath the lights.\nI prefer vibing in the darkness.\u00a0\nWill runs a hand through his hair, natural sun-touched strands, lips pursed, eyes flickering up to me. \\\"Whole group's going to be there.\\\"\nExhaling, my mind flickers to last year, a year in which we'd established some sort of makeshift group. Rough and tumble. A fucked-up, just right, too much type of family. Dysfunctional, possibly. More so, perfectly in sync.\nGavin Drew's first on the list.\u00a0\nThird member of the Boulevard Trinity. The trio that consists of one Will McClain, him, and I. Unable to be apart since forced into a group of three for a sixth grade science project.\nOne glance through the crowded halls and chances are that he'll be smack in the center, navy hoodie hanging from his torso and eyes bright, essentially exuding this calm aura, one that consists of sagged shoulders and green eyes that seem to hitch onto a perfect serene. As though the world can't shake him.\u00a0\nThen, there's Alyssa Jackson. Half-Hispanic with a grin that stretches on for miles. Moved to the state last year, arms carefully wrapped around Gavin's shoulders, a relationship that is so fucking constant, it's nearly staggering. Big smiles, dark curls.\n\nEnter Kayla Johnson. Stunning, calm and self-assured. Virtually unshakable. So close to Will that people fucking swear that they're dating. In simple terms, another force in reeling in Will McClain's energy.\nLastly, Andrea, a confident Latina, a breath of fresh oxygen with a tinge of sun. Bluntly honest and constant. Elbows likely to be linked with Alyssa Jackson's and Kayla Johnson's.\u00a0\nCraziest fucking family at T. Boulevard. A claim that can't be refuted. Chosen family. Piss each other off aggressively. Have each other's backs aggressively.\nAggressive as fuck, in simple terms.\nThem being there and me not exactly being keen on spending the evening alone is what ends me in the drivers seat of my car, Will in the passengers seat next to me.\nHe looks over at me, eyes brightened despite it being around 10 pm at night. I raise an eyebrow at him, sending a quick text to my parents before starting the car.\nSeconds later, Will leans forward in his seat and starts screwing around with the radio, badly singing along to whatever's playing on it.\nLoudly.\nAnd irritatingly.\n\\\"Do you really need to have it at that volume?\\\" I ask,\u00a0giving him major side eye.\n\\\"You're right, I don't.\\\" Will bites his bottom lip thoughtfully, and I exhale.\nThen he\u00a0increases the volume.\nI keep my eyes on the road, taking a slow intake of breath. However, it's really fucking tempting to slap the shit-eating grin clean off his face, ponder the use of an ejection button for the passengers seat.\nI make a lazy swat at him, but stormy day eyes only brighten in amusement.\u00a0\nInfinity passes before we finally pull up into Maddy's driveway. Simple house. Sleek windows, a consistent white and black theme. Overall modern look to it.\nA few cups litter the lawn, and some silhouettes whisper to each other, cups in hand as they sit in front of the house.\n\\\"Let's do this,\\\" Will smirks, and I almost groan, knowing that we might be here for a while, and that I'm definitely going to be the designated driver for tonight.\u00a0\nAs usual.\nWill's smirk widens and he ruffles my hair before I can push him away, saying \\\"Lighten up, J.J.\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

After disobeying, she is sent to Room 23, where she is tortured.\n\n#experiment #torture #doctor #sci-fi #sciencefiction #scary\n\nThe Experiment\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nCarter was once again being brought into the blinding white room. As usual, two guards held either of her arms, lifting her so that her toes grazed the ground, but only after she stopped thrashing and screaming, and let her body go limp. She now had puffy red eyes, as well as the remnants of tears on her freckled cheeks.\nHer arms began to ache due to the two men gripping them tightly. She kept her mouth shut, knowing all too well that they would ignore her if she made a sound. They reached the stark white door unreasonably quickly. The guards let go of her arms abruptly, resulting in the small girl crumbling to the ground. She quickly got to her feet, wanting to avoid any unnecessary hits or kicks from the guards. She turned the handle before walking through the door.\nJust like always, Dr. Smith was sitting in the bright red chair beside the long grey table that was reserved for Carter. He was scribbling furiously on a clipboard, eyebrows scrunched in concentration. His greying hair was tousled like always, and he was dawning his familiar white lab coat. The whole room was white. It had a blinding effect on the eyes. All that was containing colour were the test tubes and needles. They contained serums and were lined up on a tray on a countertop.\nDr. Smith looked up when he heard Carter walked in.\nA cold smile pulled at his lips, showing his dull teeth. \\\"Ah, Carter. How are you doing today?\\\"\nThe tiny girl said nothing. She kept her head down as she walked slowly towards the table.\n\\\"Not in the mood for a conversation, I see. Well, let's get to it then. Sorry to say that we have seven injections for you today.\\\"\nCarter's head snapped up, her pleading eyes meeting his cold ones.\n\\\"Please, no.\\\" She said in a small voice.\n\\\"Sorry, what was that?\\\"\nShe opened her mouth, but no words came out. Seven. She had to get seven injections.\n\nHer bottom lip trembled as she tried to form words again. \\\"Please....n-not seven.\\\"\nThe old man stood up slowly, his hands folded behind his back as he walked over to the much smaller girl.\nHe towered over her, causing her eyes to fill with fear.\nHe sighed as he bent down to match her height.\nBefore she realised what he had done, she felt a sharp pain on the left side of her face. She quickly brought up her hand to cup her cheek, eyes filling with tears.\n\\\"We have talked about being disobedient and the consequences for failing to listen, Carter. Now, be a good girl and sit up on the table.\\\"\nCarter hesitated, earning her another slap to the face from the old man. This time, she ignored the stinging sensation on her face, quickly scrambling onto the table and lying down.\nDr. Smith bound her arms and legs to the table. He carelessly dropped a pill into her mouth, just as he had done for the past several years.\nShe swallowed it without thinking, being used to it by now. She constantly wondered what it did. It didn't seem to do anything from what she could tell. But why would they give it to her if it did nothing? It had to be for something. Then again, they seemed to do a lot of things to her for no reason.\nThe man grabbed a needle from the counter as well as a disinfectant. The liquid inside the barrel was a sea green. Pretty to look at, but not fun to have injected into your body. He rubbed the disinfectant on a spot just above her elbow. The girls eyes scrunched shut, waiting for the needle. When she felt it, she got her teeth. No matter how many needles she got, she hated them. Her fear had never been overcome, even after facing it for years.\nThe worst one was the last one. Filled with ruby red contents, the needle was huge compared to the others. It felt more like a pencil being forced into her arm, rather than a needle, causing her to cry out in agony, earning a punch to the stomach. Carter curled up as much as she could whilst being bound to the table. Tears streamed from her eyes, involuntary whimpers escaping her lips. The man finished, unbinding her from the table. \nShe sat up immediately, despite the fact that she was supposed to wait for him to tell her to.\nHe cleared his throat. \\\"Room 23, Carter.\\\"\nThe girls breathing became shallow, eyes became wide. Fear bubbled in her stomach, giving her the urge to throw up. Room 23 was the main cause of her nightmares. She hadn't been there many times, but the memories of the times that she had visited haunted her.\n\\\"If you argue, you'll just earn more time in there.\\\"\nHe ushered her to the door, pushing it open to reveal the two guards from earlier.\n\\\"Room 23.\\\"\nThe guards nodded at Dr. Smith. They took Carter's arms again, dragging her to the room.\nThey reached the metal door with the large lock. Carter was having immense difficulty breathing now. When she was dropped to the floor, she stayed there, not being able to get up. One of the guards opened the door, then proceeded to try to kick her inside. They first sent a heavy blow to her back, causing her to go into the foetal position and cry out in pain. They sent more blows to her back, before giving up and picking her up once again. They threw her into the room, locking the door behind them.\nCarter didn't need to look around to know the exact details of the room. Everything was white, just like Dr. Smith's room. In the very centre of the room, a clear empty tank sat, waiting to help with Carter's torture. The large hose running through the room went through a hole into the tank, ready to fill its contents with water. On either side of the tank, metal cuffs were ready to trap the girl. Just like the previous times, she was made to take off her clothes and get in the tank. It took her too long for the guard's liking, due to her shaking limbs and strained lungs. Due to being too slow, she earned some kicks and punches. As she took off each item of clothing, she saw how many bruises and cuts she had. She counted them. She had more than usual as she had been acting up more recently. \nShe crawled slowly over to the tank, not trusting her legs. She managed to get into it, one of the guards then restraining her with the metal cuffs, while the other turned on the hose. Her arms were raised above her head, due to the fact that the tank was made so that when filled with water, the girl would be completely submerged.\nWater flooded the tank. At first, it was nice. Almost like she was a normal person about to have a cold bath. Then, the flashbacks of being in the tank the times before began coming. She tried her best to push them aside, but she couldn't. Tears began to make their way down her face, blurring her vision.\nBut soon enough, it got too high to continue crying. The water now reached her chin. She was nearly under.\nIt now reached her mouth. \nShe took in one last breath before it covered her nose.\nShe was now completely submerged. The water turned off and the guards waited.\nAt first, it was always easy. She could hold her breath without difficulty for about thirty seconds. Forty, getting harder. A minute went past. A minute and ten seconds and the girl was beginning to lose consciousness. This was pure agony. Why not breathe in now and get it over with? No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't. \nCarter finally reached her breaking point, breathing in the water. A burning sensation started in her chest, then began making its way to her entire body. It was pure torture. She had never felt anything worse, not even the injections she had to get all the time, not even the countless kicks and punches she got from the guards. This was so much worse. She wished her consciousness would just go. She even began to wish death would take her already. Being dead would be much better than this. \nHer vision soon blurred and everything went black.\n\n\n\n"}

Even when the fogs of war covered them, they still shone, somewhere behind the blanket of the sky. And that thought in itself, that even though the world was growing foul and fouler, stars were still shining, maybe forever, maybe for only tonight, was somehow comforting. Somehow necessary. All he needed was for them to shine tonight. And the night after, and the night after, until all of this was over or the world engulfed itself in flames. Yet, perhaps that was not all he needed. But it was enough, for now.\n\\\"Hey Isaiah,\\\" the whisper floated in on the wind. \nGazing high above the world Isaiah had to hear his name a second time before he was stirred. \n\\\"Yeah Mike, what is it?\\\" \n\\\"Back home, did you ever go huntin'? I mean, I loved goin' out with my old man. I'd get me a good one, you know. A fourteen-point, shot an eighteen once. I get a good one, pull the trigger, get 'em right in the side, back behind the shoulder. I hate cleanin' 'em up though. It's somethin' awful. Smells absolutely horrible, looks just terrible, almost makes a man lose his appetite to tell you the truth.\\\"\nIsaiah laughed and answered, \\\"No, Mike. No I guess I never did. It always looked fun enough though. Doesn't sound so good now, but in the past I've considered it.\\\"\n\\\"What about fishin', you had to have gone fishin'? I caught me this big ol' bass back home.\\\" Isaiah grinned as Mike held his hands completely too far apart to simulate the length of a Midwest bass, large or not. \\\"As a matter a fact, it was about a week before I left when I caught 'em. Went fishin' with a friend of mine, real good guy. This thing put up quite a fight, but I got 'em. Ain't the first time I went fishin' or else he'd have probably squirmed his way out. Made a fine dinner. Mighty fine dinner,\\\" Mike said seemingly picking his teeth of the bass he had spoken of.\nIsaiah glanced over at Mike and laughed again. \\\"I don't suppose I ever fished either. I could've I guess, just never went out. I did go out to this one pond a lot, but never to try and catch anything. Not fish at least.\\\" \n\\\"Alright then, no huntin', no fishin', what about baseball? Surely you've played some ball before.\\\"\nIsaiah looked up at the stars again and let out a breath before he replied, \\\"I watched a game once.\\\" He adjusted where he laid and chuckled. \\\"But no, never played.\\\"\nThis time Mike laughed, but it was cut short as he shifted his stare over at Isaiah. \\\"Really, Isaiah? None of those things? Not once? Not a single time, you're sayin'? Sometime you'll have to remind me and I'll go lookin' for a ball and a bat and some guys so at least maybe you can play one game before you get shot in the head. I've been known to hit a ball quite a ways, you know.\\\" Mike pretended to swing a bat several times before looking back at Isaiah. \\\"Sometimes I don't rightly know what to think of you.\\\"\nThe night rolled on overhead as the stars glided over the fields and the dirt and the men. Silence blew in with the wind, and nothing but ruffled coughs and moans could be heard. The air was cool and the wind was cold, and the men's jackets fought off the gusts that dug their way into the trenches. \nMike closed his eyes and yawned before he spoke again, \\\"Do you ever worry?\\\"\n\\\"Worry? Yeah, Mike, I do. Sometimes more than others, of course. Sometimes a lot when I think I shouldn't. Sometimes none at all, and I suppose that never makes much sense. But I worried at home before so the worry isn't exactly strange. But come on now Mike, how much can a guy worry put up in a place like this? Just add a little furnishing to these holes here and you've got yourself a mighty fine place to call home.\\\"\n\n\nA few guys around them chuckled, but Mike just opened his eyes and buttoned up his jacket. \\\"I don't know. Sometimes I just get this feelin' that I shouldn't be here, you know. That I wasn't put on the earth for this. Sometimes I worry that this ain't what I'm supposed to be doin'. That what I'm supposed to do ain't ever gonna happen. That one day that'll be me, makin' peace with the turned-up earth. With the mud.\\\"\n\\\"You might as well not talk like that. You know it doesn't do any good. Just think of being back home. Come on Mike,\\\" Isaiah urged, yet in the urging he felt strange, an imposter among foreign and inappropriate feelings. Yet he went on, \\\"Think about a fresh pie.\\\" He sniffed the air. \\\"Can you smell it? Can you taste it?\\\" Though he asked, he did not care for a taste himself.\n\\\"I can't stop thinkin' about it though.\\\" Mike exclaimed. \\\"And don't get me all worked up over here. I'm startin' to sweat. It ain't right tauntin' a man about a pie that ain't real.\\\" He paused. \\\"You remember Jed? He was a good man, he really was. Couldn't be more than a week ago I saw him on the back of a wagon. And he wasn't eatin' no pie neither. He used to stay up late with me, tellin' me all about what he was gonna do back home. His entire life plan. He really wouldn't shut up when he got goin'. He used to say, 'Now Mike,' his voice all deep and gruff like it was, you know. He would say, 'One day when we're back home, and I get my farm up and runnin' again and make myself a fortune, I'll invite you down to old Jed's house for a true welcome home party. The truest welcome home party you'll probably get.' Poor guy. He owned 200 acres up in Ohio, you know?\\\"\n\\\"Yeah, he told me that once.\\\"\n\\\"Sure would've been nice to sit down with him after all this ends. After we're all home. Talk a bit. Shoot the breeze, you know. Share a pie.\\\"\n\\\"Sure would've,\\\" Isaiah said, biting his lip. \\\"Share one, huh?\\\" he said turning on his side so Mike couldn't see him.\n\\\"We might each get our own,\\\" Mike said innocently. \\\"Hard to say. What's it to you? Anyway, stop gettin' me all sidetracked. You're good at gettin' a man sidetracked, you know that.\\\" He paused. \\\"Jed and I were gonna have that party. He said his wife cooked the best Thanksgivin' meal in any direction for fifty miles. Imagine that, would you. Said we were gonna have Thanksgivin' dinner every night I was there for as long as I wanted. Did you hear that, as long as I wanted?\\\" He stopped and looked up at the sky. The moon was bigger than usual that night. Bold and round. Like a silver Christmas ornament, delicately dangling among the stars. \\\"Turkey, stuffin', green beans, and mashed potatoes. Plus pie. And now what? Jed's gone, just like that,\\\" he snapped. \\\"Like gun smoke, up and vanished into the sky.\\\"\n\\\"Like gun smoke,\\\" Isaiah repeated. \\\"I'm sure somebody'll be more than willing to throw you a welcome home party. I'll bet they'd make Thanksgiving food if you asked nicely. People in Boston'll whip the potatoes and in New York City they'll roast the turkey for your Congressional Medal of Honor parade. Banners flying, kids cheering, confetti and fireworks. 'MIKE STANTON, AMERICAN HERO!'\\\" he said separating his hands in front him.\n\\\"Very funny,\\\" Mike said with a grin. \\\"Medal of Honor, huh? That does have a nice ring to it. Hey, maybe even the president'll put it around my neck. I'll bet the White House cooks know how to make food right. Then again,\\\" he slowed, seeming genuinely sad, \\\"they might make that little, fancy food they serve in those high-class restaurants in the city. I guess I'll have to let you know how it goes,\\\" he stopped. \\\"Well heck, I won't have to do that. You'll be right their beside me after all.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

They are going to the end of year ceremonial swim.\n\n#highschool, #fiction, #junoryear, #swim\n\nThe Plunge\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nThere was a pause in the pencil scratching against paper noise that filled the room when I stood.\u00a0 I turned my chemistry test over on the black lab bench and slunk over to the teacher's desk to ask to use the restroom.\u00a0 Mr. Hawkins eyed me suspiciously over the rims of his glasses, scratched his push broom mustache then waved me out of the room with a quick flick of his hand.\nI dashed out before he could remind me to bring the hall pass, a block of wood with the periodic table carved into it.\u00a0 It was kind of impressive, but embarrassing to carry through the hallway at school and probably pretty gross considering the numerous trips to the bathroom it had made over the course of Mr. Hawkins' thirty-year teaching career.\u00a0 I wouldn't be able to return the hall pass anyway, because my last final exam was done and I was cutting out to get a head start on the end of the school year celebration. \nI ran my fingertips along the smooth wall of orange lockers as I walked down the empty hallway.\u00a0 When I reached mine, I struggled with the combination lock for the last time, grabbed my bag and smiled when the metallic slam echoed down the hall. It was official:\u00a0 Junior year was over.\u00a0 It had been an academic hellscape complete with an AP course overload, SAT prep, an average of four to five nightly hours of sleep and an ill-advised number of extracurriculars.\u00a0 \nAfter changing into my swimsuit in the girls bathroom and throwing my t-shirt and jeans back on over it, I waited for my friends in the gym wing. The rubbery smell of basketballs wafting from the gym mingled with the humid chlorinated air from the indoor pool and the scent of floor wax and industrial disinfectants.\u00a0 This, I thought as I inhaled deeply, is the aroma of high school.\u00a0 With an added hint of overzealously applied men's body spray from the freshman wing, it would have been just right.\nWhile I waited, I scanned the class composite photographs lining the walls.\u00a0 Every graduating class of Palmer High School had a spot. Each student's face looked out from a little oval, as if gazing hopefully through a window to the future.\u00a0 In one year, I would be one of them: a hopeful face in an oval, a few weeks from finally getting out of town.\u00a0 A smile crept across my face at the thought of life beyond Palmer, Michigan.\nThe older photos were delegated to this out of the way corner of the school, but they were the most fun to look at:\u00a0 cat-eye glasses, feathered hair, pointy oversized collars in mustard, mauve and chartreuse.\u00a0\u00a0 As I made my way down the hall, the colors became more muted and eventually faded to black and white as the class sizes grew smaller and smaller.\u00a0 I came across my grandparents' graduation year and spotted them quickly in the small cluster of students that made up the class of 1953.\nRosemary Durand.\u00a0 Rose.\u00a0 My grandma's dark hair fell just past her chin in smooth waves and her charcoal grey lips smiled over her shoulder as she gazed straight at the camera. \nWalter Brooks.\u00a0 Grandpa looked more serious in his suit jacket and tie, with a hint of a pensive smile, his deep-set eyes focused somewhere beyond the photographer. \nI wondered if they went swimming in the city pool to celebrate their last day of school.\nMy grandma had been a really strong swimmer, up until literally the day she died.\u00a0\u00a0 She used to swim in the river for exercise while my grandpa walked down the boardwalk alongside her.\u00a0 Grandma Rose did a lot of typical grandma things:\u00a0 she baked pies, brought her own portable padded bleacher chair to her grandkids' sporting events, and gave us dollar bills for each 'A' on our report cards.\u00a0 But swimming in the river was pretty badass, considering that our river wasn't a brown, meandering waterway, but an international shipping channel with a swift current that stretched out deep and a blue and wide between Michigan and Canada.\u00a0 Grandpa always joked that she had the heart of a thirty year-old and would outlive him by at least a decade.\n\nI twisted the ring I had on my right hand.\u00a0\u00a0 It was a white gold band embedded with a single row of tiny sapphires.\u00a0 It had belonged to my grandma, and Grandpa Walt gave it to me on my sixteenth birthday.\u00a0 I usually didn't wear jewelry, but I slid it on my finger that morning in memory of her.\u00a0 It had been ten years to the day that she passed away.\u00a0 It turned out that she didn't actually have the heart of a thirty year-old.\nThe clicking of heels approaching startled me and I stood up straight and started walking to look like I was heading back to class.\u00a0 But it was only Sophie, striding down the hall as if it was a runway, in a bouncy floral printed skirt, a red top and strappy sandals.\u00a0 Monday through Thursday Sophie made a sweatshirt and leggings look great, but she had a thing for dressing up on Fridays.\u00a0 She said it helped make her believe the weekend was full of potential.\n\\\"Hey Soph.\u00a0 Happy Junior-Year-Is-Finally-Over Day.\\\"\nShe paused wordlessly, closed her eyes and dramatically raised her praise hands in the air, before dancing her way into the bathroom.\u00a0 Then Laura's bespectacled face peeked around the corner. \n\\\"Hey,\\\" she greeted me in a whisper.\n\\\"Hey,\\\" I whispered back, \\\"Sophie's in there already.\u00a0 Make her hurry, okay?\\\" \n\\\"I'll try.\u00a0 I might need to call you in for back up.\\\"\u00a0 She returned in a couple of minutes in a black tank top and bright green gym shorts over her bathing suit.\n\\\"She's flossing her teeth now.\u00a0 Supposedly she's almost done.\\\"\n\\\"Are you serious?\\\"\u00a0 I pushed open the door and yelled in, \\\"We're leaving!\\\" \n\\\"Two seconds!\\\" she hollered back.\u00a0 In one minute and thirty seconds we headed for the door together.\u00a0 Laura timed her.\nThe three of us became friends on one ill-fated day in gym class in the seventh grade.\u00a0 Though I guess it really was only ill-fated for Laura.\u00a0 I was sitting in the bleachers faking an ankle injury so I wouldn't have to play basketball and Sophie sat a couple rows behind me faking cramps for like the third day in a row. \nWe ignored each other until Sophie said, \\\"You're gonna need a doctor's note to get out of gym for more than three days.\\\"\nMy hand instinctively shot to my ankle and I squeezed it to relieve the imaginary pain.\u00a0 If I thought hard enough about it, my ankle actually seemed to hurt. \n\\\"It'll probably be better tomorrow,\\\" I said.\u00a0 \\\"So, cramps, again huh?\\\"\n\\\"Yeah.\\\"\u00a0 She narrowed her eyes and stared at our gym teacher presiding over the sloppy basketball game. \\\"My mom's dating Mr. Clemons.\u00a0 He really wants me and my brother to like him.\u00a0 And what I like is not participating in sports. So.\\\"\u00a0 She lifted her shoulders in a quick shrug and grinned mischievously.\nWhen my laugh echoed through the gym, Laura got distracted and a basketball hit the back of her head.\u00a0 Her glasses flew off and got stepped on, and then she was sitting in the bleachers with us looking sort of dazed. \nThe next day Sophie brought some crutches for me to borrow and a very convincing forged doctor's note that said I couldn't participate in gym class for two weeks due to a sprained ankle.\u00a0 It took ten days for Laura to get new glasses and\u00a0 Sophie refused to participate for two weeks with no repercussions.\u00a0 Even at thirteen, Sophie could be intimidating.\u00a0 She had a way of getting what she wanted by simply acting like she already had it.\u00a0\u00a0 Over the next few years she taught me several more valuable things in addition to how to get out of gym class, such as how to straighten my hair, how to disable tracking on my phone and how to drink pop through a red licorice twist.\u00a0 \nWe pushed through the heavy doors together and stood on the front steps of the school. There was something magical about the first breath of fresh air on the last day of school and the three of us paused to appreciate that moment full of possibilities.\n\n\\\"Yay,\\\" Laura sighed.\n\\\"Yay,\\\" Sophie and I responded in unison. \nThen in a deep, dramatic movie trailer narrator voice, Laura said, \\\"The Plunge.\\\"\n\\\"The Plunge,\\\" we echoed as we skipped down the stairs.\nA cool breeze tightened my skin into goosebumps. I rubbed my arms and looked up at the ceiling of low grey clouds blocking the sun. \\\"How about we skip it this year?\u00a0 It's actually freezing.\\\"\n\\\"No, it's tradition!\\\" Sophie protested.\u00a0 \\\"And ceremonial: we jump in as anxiety-ridden, exhausted juniors, then emerge renewed as seniors.\u00a0 Freezing our asses off, but no longer giving a crap about school.\\\"\n\\\"Is the pool water laced with Xanax?\\\" Laura wondered aloud.\n\\\"Last year you said we'd immerse our innocent sophomoric selves and become scholarly sex goddesses.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

The sensation was neither pleasant nor unpleasant but sent a shock of awareness through his body encasing both his dorsal and ventral trunks in an eruption of fizzes, tiny bubbles rising up his insides.\nIn response, Dr. Krill sent out a shortwave radio burst to accept the transmission as he stepped in to check on yet another of his patients. He performed a quick scan of the unmoving figure with his thermal receptors noting the proper interior heat before turning to survey the Tesraki's injuries. The patient's prognosis was poor, but that was common for those beings who initially survived intergalactic slavery rings. \nAs he was finishing his examination and stepping from the room, a second transmission burst through him bringing the earlier fizzing to a buzzing inner static.\nDr. Krill to the Emergency Bay, Dr. Krill to the Emergency Bay.\nOverhead, the internal lights of the bustling medical center lengthened to a critical red. The slight adjustment added an air of urgency to his movements as he turned towards the docking bay calling up one of the railed floor transports which quickly whisked him away, down and onward towards the emergency medical docking bay.\n\\\"Preliminary Report?\\\" he inquired as he was pulled swiftly around a corner and down another long hallway. Medical personnel stepped aside for his passing, each barely looking up from their lab results, reports, or patients as he flew past. As the primary trauma physician aboard the intergalactic transit center, he was known to always be in a hurry.\nDoctor, we have an emergency SOS from the U.N.S.S Harbinger requesting immediate medical assistance.\nDr. Krill had never heard the moniker U.N.S.S. The sounds were alien to him, in no language that he understood, and he was fluent in many languages and dialects. Even his translation equipment could not decipher the first little bit, but the second part came through.\nHarbinger: an entity or thing that heralds the arrival of another.\nQuite strange, most GA ships had numbers, not names, and such a strange name to have he thought as the transport took another corner leading him through the optics ward and out onto the central thoroughfare between the two buildings. Resting medical workers and doctors sat under an inky sky lit only by the light of their towering, neighbouring gas giant whose massive red and blue surface dominated the greater part of the night sky.\nBefore he knew it he had passed into the second building, that much closer to his destination. A distant sound of engines roared above in the night sky, the ship drawing ever closer.\n\\\"Species?\\\" he ordered as he took another corner.\nHe didn't have to wait long for the information to come through. A spotty, and somewhat unfinished, biological map of...wait...\n\\\"What species is this?\\\" He asked, letting the question hang on the air as he tried to piece through this unfamiliar information set before him.\n\\\"Human biological map. 23% completed, data restricted.\\\"\nHumans?\nDr. Krill had never seen a human before. Sure he had heard about them, who hadn't. Their discovery and eventual involvement in the Drev war had been legendary. The stories that had been brought to them by way of transport vessels and the galactic news feeds had been unbelievable, legendary and almost supernatural. For this reason, Krill doubted many of the stories. As a Vrul, he was a creature of reason, logic and science and he didn't subscribe to impossibilities, rumors or fabrications. If he were to believe anything, he would believe the knowledge gathered by his own senses.\n\n\nWhile traveling to the EMB, three of Krill's independent cortical hemispheres had been analyzing the biological map. The information was so sparse he wouldn't even attempt an autopsy if it came to that. He glanced down to see who had collected the data: Dr. Kedd. \nInteresting, he had never heard the name before, though it sounded Vrul or Gibb perhaps, not that it mattered. \nAs he drew closer to the emergency wing and its attached docking bay, Krill began to feel the rumbling. It was a powerful sensation that shook the floors and the walls as if they were experiencing a world tremor. The transport dropped him by the doors leading into the emergency bay and he scuttling across the floor as fast as his legs would consent. The door ahead opened with a sharp hiss bathing him in a mist of microbial decontaminants. The rest of the trauma team were already assembled and prepped. The doors to the docking bay had been thrown open to give them a view of the outer docking field.\nAnd what a view it was.\nA peculiar alien ship was descending from the sky on a pillar of fire, a massive black monolith supported by flames and engineered in sharp, violent metal lines which seemed to claw at the sky as if intending to rip its way through space. The sound it made was deafening, like the roaring of the stars translated from the vacuum of space directly into the engines. A few of the medical crew backed away as the ship lowered itself on its pillars of fire taking the weight of the ship as it eventually settled into a deep hunch against the ground, powerful and malefic against the dark night sky.\nAs soon as the engines cut and space was plunged back into its relative silence, light spilled from the interior of the ship. It was bright white and filled with oddly moving shadows darting quickly back and forth as the ramp lowered towards the medical bay deck. The hydraulic hiss it made as it lowered was deep and chilling, echoing across the bay like a warning call from one predator to another.\nA swarm of shadows rolled to the edge and then spilled off the ramp. Silhouetted by the bright light from behind, the ship's creatures were an amalgamation of churning limbs. The doctor was fascinated by the way the humans moved: quick and lithe one moment and then sharp but fluid the next, every movement a flowing masterpiece of muscle, sinew and bone. They were bipedal creatures, their gate precise and balanced.\nHe tore his gaze away from the approaching group and back towards the sterilization field which made his senses stiffen with dread as if a powerful predator was behind him. Is that what humans were?\nHe spread his appendages into the decontaminate field which enveloped his proffered limbs in a sterilizing, hardening gel. Behind him, one of the medical assistants activated a sterilization drape and cast it over him from behind. The field fell over his body and conformed to his shape sucking tight against his thick exterior, sealing over his eyes and mouth to prevent contamination.\nHe turned from the spot just as the creatures were pulling to a stop. He could hardly tell where one creature began and the other ended. They were just a mass of revolving multi-colored derma.\nKrill's eyes registered the intense radiation of a bright long wave light: so much red. By Sanctum's rings, he hadn't seen so much red in a long time, where was it coming from? The mass of writhing limbs was separating, pulling apart like creatures dragging themselves from the sticky pool of mud.\nHe was left with a ... strange sight. The creatures stood in a loose open circle, towering over the doctor by a good three feet in some cases. As he looked on, they turned to face him ... strange: a solid, bone frame held together by a bulging mass of tissue that absolutely writhed and churned like thousands of worm's pulsing together to create the creature's movement. At the apex of their trunk a thick round protrusion sat on a short, thick stump.\n\nGlowing orbs which glittered with a gelatinous slime stared at him from the recesses of their rubbery stumps as the worms below their derma contracted and released pulling the derma tight on a surprisingly malleable face, the biologic map reported the human word. An orifice, mouth,sat below two cavernous holes, eye sockets, in the head. The mouth opening and closing wetly like an exposed gash. These open wounds stretched back showing the horrific sight of beigetinged bone coated in slime.\nTheir thick upper limbs ended in a pentad of spidery protrusions that twitched and wriggled with their agitation. These creatures could not stay still.\nThe noises they made were deep and booming to his ears, dropping into the lower register of his hearing. Their breathy, gravely, nasally and guttural primal grunting raised in agitation and engulfed the room with their raucous and disorderly vocalizations.\nHe extended his upper limbs in a placating fashion, though, deep down he could feel fear and trepidation boiling up inside him threatening to send him retreating in the other direction. He felt his translation equipment engage.\n\\\"Where is the injured creature?\\\" \nThe group grew unusually still. Little black spots at the center of their glowing eyes contracted like they were focusing in on a target.\n\\\"Are you blind?\\\" One of the creatures boomed, throwing a bulging limb wide in a strange and aggressive gesture. The doctor stepped back in trepidation, these creature was volatile. The way its eyes darted about the room was jerky and unpredictable. It rocked back and forth just on the verge of movement and Krill felt like it might strike at any moment.\n\n\n\n"}

Because the rain was pouring like it was daring another Noah to build another ark. \nExcept, there was no Noah, just a bunch of pissed off people running around, looking for shelter. Mia fled to the nearest bar, the sound of thunder chasing her off the streets. \nShe had a love-hate relationship with rain. She loved it while she was running barefoot on the beach, savouring the cooler air. She hated it now, in the middle of September in the streets of a dirty city, smell of asphalt filling her nostrils. \nA wise observer might notice it wasn't the rain she hated. It was the city. It was constantly gloomy and dark, clouds blocking the sun and buildings blocking the clouds. \nMia fixed her auburn, now completely wet hair and entered the bar. It was cosy enough, she thought as she watched the leather seats, outlined with dark wood. The smell of beer and scotch lingered in the air and it was surprisingly empty. Windows were covered with thick, burgundy curtains and provided the kind of shelter she didn't know she needed.\nMia ordered the drink at the counter and carefully chose a booth in the furthest end of the bar, even though all the tables were scattered around, offering rare privacy. All the customers seemed to be in their own worlds, as well. Some reading newspaper, some reading books, others talking quietly amongst themselves. \nNo one was on the phone, she realised. \nIt was just what she needed, a quiet place to drink her beer and contemplate her life choices, a perfect way to end a shitty Friday evening. A ruined Friday, the worst type of day. \nShe was supposed to go downtown tonight, but all of her friends were too busy chasing their careers to have a night off. Which made her feel somewhat inadequate, considering she wasn't enjoying her career at all. At twenty four years of age, she still behaved like she was sixteen, waiting for something big to happen to her and turn her life around. \nWhat a foolish, childish dream. But no matter how hard she tried, she simply couldn't let it go. \nHer mind drifted to when she was sixteen, full of hope and ideas, thinking she was going to be someone special, thinking something brilliant was out there waiting for her. She took out her phone and called her boyfriend, Jeff.\nFirst ring. Second ring. Third ring. \nMia sighed and waited. You weren't supposed to let a phone ring more than three times if you were expecting a business call. But this wasn't business calling.\nFourth ring. Fifth ring. Sixth ring.\nShe never enjoyed calling him like this. She always felt like a burden, or like she interrupted him doing something important. A needy girlfriend calling again. \nSeventh rings. Eighth ring. \n\\\"Hi, Mia, what's up?\\\" Jeff answered.\n\\\"I'm at this bar, wanna come join me? I'll send a location.\\\" Mia asked. A long pause followed on the other line. \n\\\"I can't tonight. I'm at this business dinner with potential partners, we talked about it yesterday.\\\" He sounded somewhat sorry. But rain was falling and Mia was feeling alone, so sorry didn't cut it.\n\\\"Yeah, I know, I just thought you might want to escape the everyday life with me for a moment. It's a very cosy bar.\\\" Mia smiled, knowing it would do absolutely nothing. \n\\\"I'd love to, but I'm really busy today. But we're still going to lunch tomorrow with that high school friend of yours, right?\\\" Jeff asked. \n\\\"Yes, of course.\\\" Mia said, unable to stop the disappointment clawing at her heart.\n\n\\\"I gotta go now, I love you.\\\" Jeff said. \n\\\"Love you, too.\\\" Mia murmured in the phone and hung up. \nShe felt awful, because Jeff was a genuinely good man. He loved her, he took care of her, he supported her which made her finally finish her last year of law school. He even helped her find a job in the law firm she was currently working in. \nThe problem was, she hated the job and she hated lawyers in general. So now she felt like an ungrateful piece of shit, but she couldn't help herself. \nNot knowing what to do, she dialled her best friend, Lucy. Mia was desperate to find someone to escape with her to this gorgeous bar. Maybe because she wanted to run away and projected her feelings onto everyone else. But the truth was, people were satisfied with their lives, building their careers and not needing to run away. \n\\\"Hi, Mia! Please, tell me you're drinking tonight and not working your ass off like the rest of us.\\\" Lucy chirped on the phone and Mia smiled instantly. \n\\\"Actually, yeah.\\\" Mia looked at the glass of beer in front of her. \\\"But I'm alone. Please, come and save me.\\\" \n\\\"I'd love to, but I really can't. I'm stuck at work. Where's Jeff?\\\" Lucy asked. \n\\\"Blowing me off for a business dinner.\\\" Mia said. \n\\\"Hey, don't be mean, you know he's not blowing you off. He's working really hard.\\\" Lucy took Jeff's side and Mia understood it. \n\\\"I know, I know. I'm just bummed out because it's raining and it's Friday.\\\" Mia tapped on the wooden table with her nails.\n\\\"I get that, hun. Oh, I can't wait to be finished with this project. Then we'll go out and drink our asses off! And we'll definitely get drunk at my wedding!\\\" Lucy screamed on the other line and Mia couldn't help but smile. Lucy's wedding was in a month and she was scarily calm about it.\n\\\"Okay, go! The sooner you get back to work, the sooner you'll be finished.\\\" Mia said, deciding she could enjoy her refuge alone, if no one else wanted to join. \n\\\"Talk to you tomorrow, bye!\\\" Lucy hung up. \nMia smiled and shook her head. Lucy was like a breath of fresh air in the otherwise very stale world and Mia enjoyed her company. But tonight, she would have to enjoy her own company. Which was unmeasurably harder when you weren't satisfied with who you were. \nMia couldn't quite pin-point what her problem was, because everything seemed to be going well. She finished college, found a good-enough job and had a wonderful boyfriend. Except, she couldn't shake the feeling that time was passing by and she was watching it, waving a handkerchief at it. There was nothing to complain about and that made it so damn difficult. There was no way to explain the plain discontent she felt. \nMia closed her eyes and leaned into her booth, wondering how come it was so quiet in here, with all the rain pouring outside. Would it be too rude to listen in on other people's conversations? She put her ear to the ground and tried to see if anyone else was having a bad night. \nShe realised the people in the booth next to her were arguing.\n\\\"That's very unprofessional and quite a bit offensive! We're out of here, come on, Lincoln!\\\" A woman raised her voice and Mia was suddenly curious to see what was so offensive. \n\\\"Truth isn't offensive,\\\" a man retorted, his voice full of underlying smug, \\\"and I am honest before anything else.\\\"\n\\\"Excuse me, Mister! There is no way in hell you can simply call my wife and me bad people!\\\" Another man's voice joined the argument and Mia had to open her eyes. \nThe husband and wife were very formally dressed, he worse a suit and she wore a very nice, white blouse and grey pants. They stood up, ready to leave.\n\\\"I'm not calling you bad people. I'm just saying that if we were in Nazi Germany, you probably wouldn't be hiding Jews in your basement.\\\" The other man said, the one still sitting. Mia tried not to be too obvious, so she didn't glance in his way, but she smiled at his sentence despite herself. \nThe couple smirked and dramatically walked out in the rain, not bothering to say goodbye. Mia turned to the man in the booth who seemed equally satisfied and flabbergasted. There was a uniqueness to his face once she paid attention to it. His jaw was strong and clean-shaven, but his black bed-hair and the mischievous twinkle in his blue eyes added a boyish touch into the mix. \n\\\"I don't know. They really seemed like the type of people that put their life on the line in order to save others.\\\" Mia commented, catching the man's attention. \n\\\"Definitely a Mother Theresa and Gandhi, right there.\\\" He lifted his cup, saluting in their direction. Luckily for him, they were already gone. \n\\\"I hope they weren't family members.\\\" Mia smiled. \n\\\"Worse. Potential business partners.\\\" \nMia burst out laughing, a bit against her will and the stranger joined her. He chugged down his beer and gathered his stuff.\n \n\n\n"}

My mind spun as thoughts tumbled around half-formed. I tried to latch onto them, but they remained out of reach, taunting me.\nStop thinking. Stop thinking.\nI took a deep breath, but the humid air and the lingering smell of stale beer and sweat didn't help with my motion sickness. The bus jolted as we bumped over something on the road, and my stomach lurched. My head rattled against the window. I grimaced. The glass vibrated and buzzed like the bus was trying to shake itself apart. The bunk across from me creaked as Jake stirred and rolled over, but he didn't wake up.\nLucky bastard.\nI wasn't going to sleep tonight. It wasn't going to happen. I took out my phone and hit the home button. The bright glow of the screen burned my dilated eyes, and I squinted until the display became clear.\n2:47 a.m.\nI scowled. How was it not even three yet? I'd been lying here for what felt like hours.\nI flipped my phone to the camera and put it in selfie mode. There was just enough ambient glow from the emergency lights at the floor of the bus to illuminate my face. I pushed my mess of dyed-black hair out of my eyes, trying to untangle it. I needed to fix my roots, but I knew I would fuck it up for sure. Maybe I could get Veronica to do it for me.\nThe heavy bags under my eyes looked even darker than usual, but other than that, I didn't look too bad for a guy who hasn't slept in nearly three days.\nI put on a slight smile and snapped a photo of myself. I took two more in case the first turned out bad. After sitting up, I opened Instagram and switched from the Make Them Scream shared account to my own. The screen froze for half a minute as it loaded, stretching to get signal. The bus's WiFi crapped out two days ago when someone spilled beer on the router, and we hadn't been able to get it working since.\n\\\"Come on.\\\" I shook the phone and tapped the cracked, smudged screen, like that might somehow help it load. \\\"Stupid piece of shit.\\\" Finally, the main screen popped up, and I uploaded the picture of myself. \n3am on the tour bus somewhere in Montana and I can't sleep. Too excited for the show tomorrow night. Looking forward to seeing all of your beautiful faces Seattle. xoxo Alex\nAfter cringing at the caption I'd typed and vomiting in my mouth just the tiniest little bit, I added the obligatory hashtags:\nMakeThemScream, Wolfpack, DontBlinkTour2022, Seattle, IveSoldMySoul, LoveMe, AttentionWhore, Desperate\nI quickly backspaced the last four tags and hit the post button.\n\nThe loading screen spun for a few seconds, and then it stopped. I glanced at the upper left corner of the screen.\nNo service. Fuck.\nI rolled my eyes.\nOh well. God bless Verizon's spotty service for preventing me from posting stupid shit to Instagram in the middle of the night.\nI slipped my phone into my pocket and got up. The bus turned as it careened down the road, and I gripped the side of the bunk to keep myself from falling over.\nFucking Liz was driving like a crazy person.\nI stumbled up the aisle to the front of the bus, bracing myself on the small plastic table that was bolted to the floor as we took another turn.\n\\\"Are you trying to kill us, woman?\\\" I asked, plopping down in the passenger seat next to her.\nLiz glanced at me, her blue eyes catching mine. They were bloodshot, and her heavy eyeliner and mascara were streaked and smudged like she'd been rubbing them. She always insisted on driving the night shift. Something about enjoying the peace and quiet.\n\\\"This road's so fucking narrow.\\\" She masked a yawn as she turned her attention back to driving. \\\"I can hardly tell when a curve's coming up.\\\"\nTall pine trees towered around us like the walls of a cave. Their branches swayed in a gust, casting eerie shadows on the road ahead of us. We were in the middle of fucking nowhere. There weren't even any streetlights, just the bus's high-beams. \n\\\"Whose bright idea was it to book gigs in Chicago and Seattle two days apart, anyway?\\\" I asked.\nLiz chuckled and pushed her blond hair out of her face. She had it shaved on one side, which I thought made her look pretty hot. Although, Liz didn't have to do anything to look hot. She was 5'10\\\", mostly legs, drop dead gorgeous and played the fucking drums. End of story.\n\\\"We're lucky Wolfpack even invited us on this tour,\\\" Liz said. \\\"We just have to deal with the shitty schedule.\\\"\nShe drummed her black-and-white-painted fingernails on the steering wheel. She never listened to music when she drove. She liked to use the silence to make up her own rhythms. I wondered what was going on up there in that head of hers.\nWind howled as it beat against the bus. The road dipped down over a hill, curving through the thick, dark forest. The wheels screeched as we barreled around it, and I clenched my teeth, gripping the arm rest.\n\\\"Can I drive?\\\" I asked.\n\\\"I don't think that's such a good idea.\\\"\n\\\"I have insomnia, not narcolepsy, Liz.\\\" I smirked, but her attention was still on the road. \\\"I'm not going to just pass out while I'm driving or something.\\\"\nLiz was quiet for nearly a minute. Her jaw tensed and released as she avoided making eye contact with me. \\\"What happened at the show in Cleveland scared me, Alex,\\\" she finally responded.\n\\\"It wasn't a big deal.\\\"\n\\\"You passed out on stage. It was scary.\\\"\n\\\"The paramedics said it was probably just exhaustion. I'm fine.\\\" I noticed I was biting my nails, so I quickly pulled my hand away from my teeth and balled it into a fist at my side.\n\n\\\"They also said you should go to a doctor and get checked out, which you haven't done.\\\"\n\\\"Maybe I'll do that after the tour. I don't have the time for making an appointment or anything right now. I can't miss a show.\\\"\nLiz snorted. \\\"You're going to die young, Alexander Pierce. But it's not going to be because you pass out driving our tour bus and crash. That would mean I'd die too, and that ain't gonna happen.\\\"\nI rolled my eyes and stared out the windshield. The string of Mardi Gras beads hanging from our rear view mirror clanked as they swung back and forth like a metronome. I focused on the winding road ahead of us, where the dark shapes of pine trees zoomed by, creeping in closer and closer the further we went. The lanes were so narrow, I wasn't even sure a car would be able to pass going the other direction.\nI leaned back in the seat. My eyelids felt like they were weighted down by anchors. The exhaustion was painful, but my body wouldn't let me fall asleep. I didn't tell Liz, but the reason I didn't want to get checked out wasn't because I didn't have the time. It was because I was scared. What if there actually was something wrong with me? What if they couldn't fix it?\nMy eyes slipped closed for a second. I immediately snapped them back open, shaking my head to clear my mind. It was better if I didn't know. It was better if I could keep pretending there was nothing wrong. I could live like this.\nShifting in my seat, I searched through the pocket on the passenger side door until I found an energy drink. Liz must have bought it when she stopped for gas . . . but it was mine now! When I cracked it open, the wonderful and sick smell of chemicals filled the air.\n\n\n\n"}

In the middle of the night she sneaks out through the trees with friends Angel, Blanche and Cale.\n\n#friendship, #midnight, #run-away, #school, #campus, #military\n\nSneak Away\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nPawai Johansen knew that Mayanne and her other roommates, Jernelle Naagrod and Zaria Rahal, would be going to bed early on Tuesday night. They all had early classes Wednesday morning. \nIt wasn't strange for Pawai to stay up later than them, so nothing was said as Mayanne Vale settled into the bunk above Pawai's and Jernelle rolled over to face the wall. \nPawai didn't look up from the stack of papers she was reading. She flipped the page, her eyes staring at the words, but her ears listening to the other's breathing. Waiting for Zaria Rahal's soft snores.\nBlankets shuffled, and the bunks creaked as they settled in. The room was square. One wall was lumber with a single-window high above where bugs ticked off the screen. Cool air wafted in, smelling like the beginning of fall, but the inside of the building was still hot and stuffy. The other three walls were partitions, woven fabric pulled tight over frames. \nIf one of them stood on the top bunk, they were head and shoulders above the partition and could call out to other rooms. All identical. Two bunk beds, wardrobes, and four occupants, sprawled out on their beds, tossing as the once cool sheets turned hot and sticky beneath them. A double row of fans rotated on the pitched ceiling above. \nThe other side of Gamma house was a mirror image of this one. In the center were the common room, washrooms, and Mr. Tuma, their head of house's quarters.\nGamma house grew silent as the whispering petered out. The fans droned, and bugs pinged the screen. Pawai turned another page. Time had taken on the consistency of molasses, cold molasses. \nZaria began to snore. The globe of one of the moons moved into view of the window. No clouds. It was a bright night full of stars. Pawai watched the small moon, its progress was a more accurate mark of time than her pretend reading.\nCautiously, Pawai set the stack of papers onto the nightstand. She spent a large portion of her government-provided monthly allowance on printing those papers and the candles to read them by, she would be careful with them. \nThe silence of the building pushed in on her. Her legs swung out, and the floorboards creaked as she put her weight down. Staying hunched over, she squinted up at the top bunk, expecting to see Mayanne's bright eyes staring at her. Instead, it was the back of Mayanne's blonde head.\nPawai took a step back. Nothing. Mayanne didn't move. She took another step back. Her candle wobbled in her hand. \nShe could see Zaria now, in the other top bunk, a mass of dark curls and sprawled limbs. He was sleeping. Jernelle didn't turn either. They were all sleeping. The moonslight reflected back at her off the large mirror Zaria had maneuvered into their room, creating a makeshift vanity. \nPawai's reflection startled her, short orange hair curling out into frizzy points. Her skin covered by blotchy masses of erratic skin tones that in the Cradle had been sparse freckles, but had taken over most of her in the four years she had been on the planet.\nBut it was just her reflection, short stature, sticky pajamas, wide face, and all. Moving again, Pawai was out the door, down the south hallway, and into the common room. \nShe paused there, her eyes scanning the darkness, ready to start heading for the toilets if she spotted someone. It was empty, the couches and tables barren. Forgotten papers rocking with the fans overhead.\nTeeth glinting in the night, Pawai speed walked across the room and to the door. She blew out her candle and set it on a table next to a worn deck of cards, and then as quietly as was possible with the heavy front door, Pawai had it open enough to slide out and then closed behind her.\n\n\nPawai rocked back on her heels, grinning at Gamma house. Then, she turned and pelted across the front lawn, into the meadow, up the nearest hill, and under a copse of trees. She batted away bugs while she waited, breathing heavily. \nThe plants seemed to smell stronger at night. Rough bark pressed against her back. Bats swooped silently overhead, helping her with the bugs. She rubbed her arms. The trees and plants were still warm from the day, clinging to summer, but the air was tight and cold, ready for fall. Not severe enough to drop the bugs, though.\nBouncing on her toes again, Pawai peered out, knowing that she had to be careful, her orange hair was a bright spot of color. \nThe moon above was nearly full, the other a pock-marked half, the third moon was too far away to be anything more than a bright star when it was visible this time of year, and she didn't bother scanning the clear sky to see if it was. \nThe three houses, Gamma, Theta, and Alpha, looked pale and lifeless.\nFour figures popped out of the door to Alpha house, slinking past Gamma and Theta and into the meadow. The smallest one at the rear tripped in the grass and cursed, ran to catch up.\nAngel Lemaro reached Pawai first, looking as calm and relaxed as ever. All brooding features and dark, calculating eyes. Blanche and Cale followed, arguing about something that had looked like a snake further back. \nContrary to colonial trends, Blanche Xiong let her hair grow long and kept it tied into a tail at the base of her neck, sliding down her spine like a river of inky darkness. \nCale Payne was quick and graceful, with an upturn to the corners of his mouth that made it hard to tell if he ever was upset or serious. \nLeric Dobicceli came last, wiping dirt from her knees. There were pillow marks on her pug-dog face, and her eyes looked two steps from closing. She was thick and solid, compacted like she had grown under heavy gravity.\nThere was a silent nod of greeting. Exchanging of excited grins. They cut down through the meadow, Blanche leading the way with her long legs. They paused on the far side, looking carefully at the cluster of buildings, their eyes scanned for movement. The windows were dark. A generator droned somewhere in the back.\nCale Payne walked out first, strolling out onto the path like he was meant to be there. Not wanting to be outdone in bravery, Blanche Xiong was behind him, past him, walking down the center of the path and past the buildings. The others followed.\nThey cut through the field of solar panels, the lass rows dotted with fallen leaves. The silent sentinels in the night, reflecting moonslight, and giving the group cover until they reached the tree line.\nPassing under the full branches, darkness drew closer. The group drew closer. \nCursing, Leric stumbled on a tree root. Pawai caught her arm and linked hers through it. A flashlight strobing through the foliage was something none of them wanted to risk so they stumbled through the dark.\n\\\"This way, yeah,\\\" Blanche said, heading off of the path and down. The slope had fewer trees on it, there was more light to see by. The stream glinted ahead. \nBlanche took the hill first but then was passed by Cale. The two raced, grabbing on to saplings to keep from cartwheeling down the slope. Their whoops and shouts echoed back.\n\\\"It'll be fine,\\\" Angel comforted Pawai and Leric. He followed more slowly.\nPawai and Leric exchanged a look.\n\\\"Together?\\\" Pawai said, holding out her hand.\nLeric swallowed hard and then nodded. Pawai pulled her along.\n\n\n\n"}

After that she goes down to the TV studio where she is an actor on a show called Legendary. She does not want to go to Hollywood.\n\n#actor, #actress, #entertainment, #teacher, #musical, #drama, #work \n\nThe Teacher\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nIf Jensen Rhodes had to hear someone sing Tomorrow from Annie one more time, she was going to cancel the school musical entirely. \nThe school production wasn't even Annie\u2014it was 9 to 5. And by God, she hadn't heard any renditions of Backwoods Barbie at all. She'd avoided listening to the official cast recording to brace herself for it. She was almost looking forward to it. Disappointing. Jensen would've even accepted Heart to Hart. \nHer heart was already set on the perfect Roz anyway. Auditions were formalities. Was that bad? Probably. Had she done it any way? Not officially. Officially, it was after an hour of listening to auditions. To that fucking Tomorrow song.\nA new face walked to centre stage. Smiling too wide, Jensen recognized her student almost instantly. She'd been in Jensen's drama classes since her first year at Northside.\nJensen looked down at her audition sheet and marked the girl down. \\\"Who are you auditioning for and what will you be singing this afternoon?\\\" she asked as she looked up from her papers.\n\\\"I'm auditioning for Doralee.\\\" The girl smiled. Her tinny braces reflected the stage lights like a disco ball. \\\"And my song is Tomorrow from Annie.\\\"\nJensen almost groaned. At least this cover was half decent. She might've got up and left if she heard another voice crack. But she didn't. Because if someone ever did that to her, she'd cry. Last thing she wanted was to do that to a high schooler.\nWhen Jensen did leave, however, it was because she had work to do downtown and staying at the high school any longer would've made her late. She left auditions humming anything that would get the idea of tomorrow out of her head. Both the song and her actual tomorrow. Because tomorrow meant auditions. Again. Not simply for the school play. Jensen had her own to worry about and she would not be doing a dramatic monologue of Tomorrow, that was for certain.\nThe weather was having trouble deciding if it was autumn still or winter yet, so Jensen tugged her thin hoodie around her waist and pulled the hood over the mountain of curls on her head. She swore she'd worn aviators to shield her eyes from the sun that morning, but now she could see her breath disappear into the cold air. Weather liked to change hourly in Vancouver.\nThe place where it was summer in the morning, winter at night. All in the middle of October when it was supposed to be neither. The weather could span all four seasons in a day, or spend months locked in spring showers mode even when it wasn't April. Most of the time the rain didn't bring any flowers, either. Just annoyed Vancouverites who spent most of their days complaining about the weather. Jensen was one of those Vancouverites. She was woman enough to admit that while also simultaneously complaining about people complaining about the weather. \nVancouver wasn't all bad. Sure, it rained a lot. But it also had a good entertainment district, which Jensen was headed straight to the moment she'd buckled her seatbelt in her piece of shit car. \nVancouver was TV land\u2014where wannabe actors came to prosper and dreams only lived in those who didn't want Hollywood. Such as it was for Jensen Rhodes who was happy as a high school teacher. Acting helped pay her portion of rent in her too expensive apartment.\nActing was never the be all, end all for Jensen. It never had been. Was it ever the be all, end all for anyone? Surely not. Some people ended up there because they weren't prepared to do anything else. That's why they graced glossy magazine covers and attended events with too many flashing cameras\u2014to be seen, to be focused on. To be justified. \nBut the glitz and glam wasn't really what they wanted. Right?\nFor Jensen, the answer was right. And that was all she cared about.\n\nShe was perfectly fine in her overpriced, two bedroom apartment with too many DVDs (hers) and shitty magazines all over the place (her roommate's). With scripts laying across the ancient coffee table in the middle of her sitting room that she wanted to get rid of because she kept stubbing her toe on it. But it also reminded her to practice her lines, so maybe it needed to stay. \nRemembering lines was easy for her; it always had been. Whether it was Drama 9 or her debut as Maureen in RENT at the Queen Elizabeth Theatre. The acting? That was the hard part. Being in front of people and the thought that if she messed up, they'd have to start all over again. It almost made her want to be in live theatre again. At least that way, she'd know better than to mess up. The theatre made sure she was on her game when she had to go on stage\u2014the skin tight leather pants she'd had to be sewn into also helped. \nThe only good thing about filming in Gastown was that the traffic was headed in the opposite direction from her when she drove in rush hour. Gastown was a place where tourists, no matter the time of the year, came to ogle at the steam clock when it whistled. Which was every fifteen minutes and not as exciting the hundredth time around. But people still stared. And filmed. And generally ignored that Jensen's show Legendary was filming the block over, which was nice. \nMaybe there were two good things about Gastown.\nLegendary needed good sometimes. It was really all they had. They weren't an A-list cast, but they got recognized. Mostly by fans who watched the West Coast rerun of an already- premiered-on-the-East-Coast episode but recognized all the same. They had enough of a following that the show kept getting renewed\u2014and that's what it was really about, right? Being there for the fans?\nBut that's how Jensen wound up in Gastown on a Thursday afternoon, wasn't it? Fans had liked her and she got a longer contract. It was a blessing and a curse. \nHer agent, Lucille Gold, had been over the moon when they got the call. You're one step closer to Hollywood, she'd said. All pixie cut and brown lipstick and take-no-shit tones. This could be your one-way ticket.\nHollywood was Lucille's ultimate goal for Jensen\u2014despite her not wanting it. At least, she couldn't see herself wanting it. Being away from the busy mornings. And the unreliable buses. And the kids she taught that made it all worth it. Except when they sang Annie. Fuck Tomorrow. \nIf she'd said that, Lucille would've ignored her. Like she did any time Jensen said something she didn't like. She'd rifle through papers while humming until Jensen corrected herself. And by 'correcting herself,' of course, that means she said exactly what Lucille wanted to hear. Something stupid like Can't wait or Yay or even a rare combination of the two.\nThen Lucille would look up at her, put on that Good as Gold Talents coveted smile, and say something annoying along the lines of, That's what I thought you said. \nThe steam clock whistled as Jensen was about to drive her car past it. She had to pay extra close attention because if she couldn't get past before the clock performance was finished, she had a good chance of hitting someone who decided to walk off the sidewalk into the oncoming traffic. (Or lack thereof\u2014traffic, that was.) (The point still stood: Jensen didn't want a manslaughter charge.) It was hard enough to maneuver when tourists weren't moving. Looking at her dashboard clock, Jensen had eighteen chimes of the clock to get past the crowd of onlookers. Gastown's clock always chimed the longest on the hour. \nJensen was almost late by the time she found parking and made it past the clock crowd. If she'd had to pay in a meter, she probably would have been.\n\nIf it was any consolation, walking around Gastown as the sky grew darker was always nice. Curved arms of gun metal lampposts wrapped around wide sphere lights. They illuminated the coffee cafes and knick knack shops. If Gastown didn't have as many tourists, it would have been the light of downtown Vancouver. \nMaybe it was in spite of that. \nRunning into her trailer, Jensen only had around two minutes to inhale the sad chicken sandwich she had packed for dinner before her makeup and hair people came in to get her ready for the night. \n\n\n\n"}

Out.\nFocusing on her breathing was the only thing that kept Rebecca Eaves from letting her mind wander to other places when she ran. If she let her mind wander, her mind would start to focus on the fact that her legs hurt, and that her chest hurt, and that everything about running hurt. If she let her mind wander, she would be reminded of the fact that she had two pints of Ben & Jerry's Brownie Batter Core ice cream sitting in her freezer that were begging to be eaten, and that eating both of those in one sitting would feel great. Relaxing. Eating. Not worrying about her weight.\nIn. Out. In. Out.\nIf she let her mind wander, she would start to tell herself that she didn't need to finish running the five miles to get the reward of a quarter of one of those pints. She would stop her run, powerwalk back to where her car was parked just a mile and a half behind her current position, and drive home, to the apartment she was still in the process of moving into. She would watch Kaylie's disapproving stare as she ate her ice cream instead of unpacking her boxes. She would feel guilty afterwards for eating her ice cream without finishing her run first. So, Rebecca kept running.\nIn. Out. In. Out.\nIt was a beautiful day. Early September, two days before the first classes of Fall semester began, and the sun was shining through a soft cloud cover. At 10:12 AM, it wasn't too terribly hot, but the humidity was at 79% already according to Rebecca's weather app, which meant that she was already sweating after a mile and a half of running at a relatively moderate speed. Not a jog, but not quite a run yet. Somewhere in between.\nIn. Out. In. Out.\nRebecca kept moving halfway between jogging and running. She kept going, one foot in front of the other, focusing on her breathing, until the time on her Fitbit read 10:38, and she had made a five-mile circle back to the parking lot outside of the furniture store half a mile outside of the park she ran in when she didn't feel like going to the gym. She unlocked her car door and climbed into the driver's seat, taking a sip of water before pulling out her phone to check her text messages and disconnect her wireless headphones. She had a text from Kaylie waiting for her. When was she planning on unpacking the boxes? It had been over a week since she had moved in. It was getting hard to walk. Rebecca shook her head and ignored the message, backing out of the parking space and pulling onto the main road to head back home.\n\nIn. Out. In. Out.\n\\\"Clemson is so much better than UMD.\\\"\nRebecca rolled her eyes as she walked into the kitchen on the evening of the day after Labor Day, her right hand wrapped around a bottle of cucumber water and her left clutching her daily planner. Work had been terrible that night, with old women yelling at her for not accepting their coupons and old men touching her hand for no reason other than to make her feel like taking a bath in the same sanitizer they used to clean the floors. 10:00 had brought freedom, and by 10:38 she was in sweatpants and ready to plan out the rest of her week.\n\n\\\"You've had one day of classes so far, Cel.\\\" She replied before sitting at the kitchen table and setting her planner down, \\\"You spent two years at UMD. I don't think you have the right frame of reference yet.\\\"\nCeleste Becker shrugged absentmindedly in response.\n\\\"Maybe following a high school boyfriend to an out of state college wasn't the smartest choice.\\\" Rebecca grinned slightly, \\\"I'm glad that you're back where you belong.\\\"\nCeleste smiled.\n\\\"Me, too. The gang's back together!\\\" She bounced up and down excitedly, her heels moving onto and off of the floor in quick succession, \\\"I don't think I had seen Spencer since high school. Did you guys hang out a lot last year?\\\"\nRebecca nodded.\n\\\"Yeah, all the time. It got kinda weird when he confessed his love for me, but we moved past it.\\\"\nCeleste's eyes bugged out of her head and she opened her mouth to speak before being cut off by their third and fourth roommates walking in to the apartment, two girls who had also been friends since high school...just at a different high school.\n\\\"Aw good, you're home.\\\" Kaylie Ernest shrugged a deep maroon purse off of her shoulder and left it on the table beside Rebecca, \\\"And I see that the boxes finally made their way out of the living room.\\\"\nRebecca bit her tongue, unwilling to engage in any sort of argument with the girl. Everything about Kaylie Ernest screamed everything that Rebecca loathed in a person: the judgement she exuded towards anyone she deemed 'below' her\u2014whether that was via social status, wealth, physical attractiveness, intelligence, or anything that someone could be 'better' than someone else at\u2014the way she spoke as if she were spewing facts every moment of the day instead of complete garbage, and the way she expected everyone she lived with to live exactly how she wanted them to.\nHer best friend was better, and for the life of her Rebecca couldn't figure out why Jamie Renner was friends with the monster that occupied one of the rooms in the apartment. Jamie was sweet, albeit a bit ditzy, but with a good heart and a preoccupation with ensuring that everyone around her was having a better time than she was. Rebecca suspected her kindness was the reason Jamie was most likely Kaylie's only friend.\n\\\"Yeah sorry, they were all mine.\\\" Celeste sighed theatrically, \\\"I've just been so busy sitting around this giant apartment and remembering what it was like when I went to a school with a 48% acceptance rate instead of 50% like this one. How simple you all must feel.\\\"\nRebecca stifled her laughter at Kaylie's bewildered expression as Celeste waved her fingers at the group and walked off towards her bedroom. The other two looked at each other for a second in silence before walking off to their own respective rooms, shutting the doors with varying levels of severity.\nRebecca looked down at her meticulously color-coded planner, listing everything she had to remember about her 38-hour work weeks on top of a 16-credit class schedule. She had mapped everything out perfectly, allowing enough time for work, school, homework, and working out every single day. She was ready for everything the year would throw at her, her and her color-coded planner. Everything had a place. And everything had a time to get done.\nShe closed the yellow-and-white striped planner and took a sip of the cucumber water floating in her knockoff grey Hydroflask\u2014which went perfectly with her knockoff Lululemon leggings that she wore to a fault. She shook memories of the terrible customers in the grocery store out of her head and picked up her phone, beginning her nightly scroll through the accounts of people with lives that looked so much better than her own on the screen.\nFitness blogger with their workout of the day, paired with an ad about their favorite protein powder. Nutritionist blogger with a photo explaining the difference in macros between a Big Mac and a Greek salad. A girl from high school posting about how she was nearly eight months pregnant and so excited to be a mother while her baby daddy stared on from the background of the picture, looking like he wanted anything other than being made a father at 21. \nA girl from Clemson who Rebecca had never met, but who led the picture-perfect life, with plenty of friends, the perfect bikini body, and seemingly no time spent in class. Rebecca had been following @kabe99 for over a year by then. She had never actually seen her on campus, but she had heard stories.\nEverything about social media made Rebecca want to vomit, cry, and laugh at the same time. She wanted to live the lives of the people she saw online. But instead, her own Instagram feed was filled with pictures of Celeste on FaceTime calls from when she lived in Maryland and grainy images that she had pulled from being tagged on Facebook.\nRebecca opened Instagram again after closing it five different times and decided she was feeling like uploading her own picture. She hadn't posted in over two months\u2014not that anyone cared\u2014and she felt like maybe people would want to see something from her.\nShe had taken a picture of the sunrise before a morning jog the week before. She uploaded it and took a few seconds to think of the caption \\\"sunrise run = losing 20 pounds by christmas\\\". All lower case. She was pretty sure it was more aesthetically pleasing that way. She hit 'post' and put her phone down, telling herself not to care about the likes or comments the picture surely would get.\n\n\n\n"}

A much more pressing issue was the fact that her roommates and best friends were unable to see her vision for turning the empty fourth bedroom in their apartment into an Airbnb rental.\n\\\"I feel like it's illegal. Like it goes against our lease or something.\\\" Lyla Rose shook her head adamantly, clearly unwilling to see Kennedy's plan being executed well. Hardly any of them ever were.\n\\\"I dunno. It's not like we haven't broken lease agreements before.\\\" Rian Clark replied, twirling a strand of cropped ginger hair around her finger. \\\"I feel like as long as we don't get caught, we could totally do it. Plus, we could charge extra for game day weekends.\\\"\nLyla was quiet for a moment and Kennedy felt herself starting to become impatient. Everything about this was perfect: they had a spare room in the apartment, they all knew self defense if any of the guests became suspicious, and it would mean that they didn't have to get real jobs for at least another semester.\n\\\"Ly, this isn't a difficult decision. Everything about this makes sense, I don't see\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Fine.\\\" Lyla sighed loudly and stood up from her seat at the kitchen table, \\\"But just double check that the locks on our doors all work, please.\\\"\n\\\"For sure.\\\" Kennedy nodded, her chest filling with the excitement she got when a plan came together. She had been the mastermind behind every plan the girls had ever participated in...the last of which had gotten them kicked out of their previous apartment and forced them to move into this new one with the spare bedroom.\nLyla left the kitchen and headed for her bedroom as Kennedy checked her phone. 11:52. She was supposed to be in class by noon, and she hadn't even bothered doing her makeup or hair yet. She wouldn't be ready to go until at least 1:00, and by that time she would have missed her first class and been late for her second. Might as well not go to any of her four classes at all.\nRian started babbling about some new dance routine she wanted to try out before their next party and Kennedy tuned her out, picking up her phone and beginning to scroll through Instagram. Makeup guru with a picture of their latest makeup palette and a tag from the company sponsoring the palette in the first place. Actress with a post about her two kids and how they kept her grounded through the whirlwind of Hollywood. Some girl with a photo of a sunrise that had four likes and no comments on it. A Clemson football player posting about that weekend's game and how they needed the student body's support now more than ever.\nKennedy went to her own profile, where she had posted a picture the night before of her and Rian at the last football game, with orange streaks under their eyes and bottles that no longer had to be blurred out since she had turned 21. 579 likes and 48 comments since the night before. Not bad for @kenn111's 3,782 followers.\nRian was still talking. Why didn't she ever stop talking? Kennedy was sure that she hadn't talked so much when the two first became friends. But maybe that was just Kennedy's rose-colored glasses, looking back on when she had decided to become friends with two girls who had catapulted her onto the hall of fame at Harvard, allowing her to live her best life while simultaneously living out every nightmare she had ever had.\nKennedy shook her head slightly and focused again on Rian. Maybe the issue wasn't that Rian talked so much. Maybe it was that she talked about such terribly dull things. Kennedy was ready to meet someone who didn't talk about hair and makeup all the time. Someone who could play her in a volleyball game and bring back some of the competitiveness the girl had felt in high school. Someone different from her normal crowd.\nBut Rian was fine. For now.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nMagic University: Carnation is second year student at at the Clair De Lune Magic Academy in the Kingdom of Glassgalia. It is the only university for magic in the world. She talks to her friend Seraphina and thinks about a handsome boys she saw.\n\n#adventure, #beautiful, #comingofage, #fantasy, #fantasyromance, #fiction, #friendship, #friends,#love, #magic, #collage\n\nMagic University\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nIf you were rich enough to hire a flying-carriage, or happened to be born with wings (like I was), then you could take an aerial tour of the Kingdom of Glassgalia. Let's say you did hire a flying carriage. Starting from the city of Verri\u00e8re, with its turreted castles and imposing mansions, you could fly over the wide expanse of pristine meadows to the red brick roofs of the town of Seirelenne, circle around the Clair De Lune Academy, follow the bends of the glittering Coralline river, and finally skim the misty forests bordering the kingdom. The whole 'Airelle tour' takes an hour-and-a-half one way. It's terribly expensive, but it's a breathtaking experience that every citizen of Glassgalia dreams of fulfilling at least once in their lifetime. \nI'm a student at the above-mentioned Clair De Lune Magic Academy of Arts and Sciences. When I first saw the Academy, I remember standing still in silent awe. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Moss-covered grey walls flanked the entrance, towering imposingly and tapering off into battlements around the terrace. Regally erect, the buildings rested among a sprawling, expansive campus, with a canopy of trees lining the paths and extending curious branches into some of the upper classrooms. Among all of the Academy's superior features- after all, it was the only Magic School in the world- I admit that the verdant gardens were my absolute favourite. (I have a soft spot for anything green and flowery).\nThe student handbook had an interesting collection of stories and myths about the castle which formed the location for the current Clair De Lune Academy of Magic Arts and Sciences. I remember eagerly reading through all the snippets of information I could get while applying to the Academy a year ago. The most intriguing one, however, was the anecdote about how the Academy got its name.\nAeons ago, as the Legend goes, a piece of the Moon was stolen by a Mage- an ancient ancestor of the present Kingdom of Glassgalia. He was a Light Mage with extraordinary powers and skills, able to accomplish something as difficult as causing an asteroid- the piece of the moon- to fall onto the surface of the earth. With that piece of moon rock, he built the Clair de Lune Castle, and because of his incomparable powers, he became the King of the surrounding lands, then known as Vitrum. But no one can take from nature without giving something back in return- the fine equilibrium of existence cannot be unbalanced, whatever the reason. The Mage had to give up his magic powers of light in order to repay the wrong he had done. To save his power from perishing with him, he created a spell through which his powers would be passed down to his children, and that's how the royal line of present-day Glassgalia came into existence. \nThough no longer a castle today, the Academy is perhaps just as influential, a prestigious institution in the history of the world. It is the only academy for magic skills, because very few magic mages exist today. At any point of time in the world, only a specific number of magic powers can exist- there is, after all, a limit to the Mages possessing different kinds of magic powers. These powers have been used to help with a specific purpose and also have been misused, in wars and criminal activities. Eventually, laws had to be passed to safeguard the identity of the mage, as children possessing these powers were kidnapped and forced to use them for illegal activities. Children gifted with the power of a mage are hidden or their powers kept a secret from the outside world, until they are old enough to control them. Some parents send their children to the Academy, but most try to prevent their children from practising their magic, due to the fear of what might happen if people with ulterior motives discover their identity. \n\\\"Somehow, I had an inkling that you would be here.\\\" A sudden voice pierced through my reverie, dissipating the fog of musing in which I was wrapped. It was Seraphina Resollain, my closest friend and roommate at the Briar Dormitory. A sunny, outgoing person, she was the first friend I made when I was new to the Academy. In fact, our acquaintance had been formed right here at the entrance, where I had been standing and staring in wonder at the massive wood-panelled doors set in stone- just like I was doing right now.\n\\\"I think it's somewhat of a small tradition now,\\\" I answered, smiling at her enthusiasm. \\\"Can you believe that we're in our second year of university already?\\\"\n\\\"Carnation Trellis, I was trying not to remind myself of that!\\\" Gathering her shining golden curls into a ponytail, Seraphina whined at my matter-of-factness. \\\"I still have to decide what major I'm going to choose, and it's driving me crazy!\\\" Her blue eyes scrunched up in half-exaggerated, half-genuine dismay as she considered the arduous mental task lying ahead of us. \\\"I'm stuck between Music Theory and Musical Theatre!\\\"\n\\\"Well, you can hardly avoid that topic, because it's literally our first day today,\\\" I teased. As second years, we had to choose the subjects pertaining to the major we wanted for our final year, at the end of the term. The Academy has two broad divisions of fields under which all subjects fall under: the Magic Arts and the Magic Sciences. As a Mage of Animals, typically, I would be expected to opt for the Magic Sciences Division if I wanted to become a Special Veterinarian, which had been my original plan. Now...I'm not so sure anymore. \n\\\"We'll figure it out,\\\" I said, trying to sound confident and decisive. It failed, because Seraph gave me a Look that screamed 'Uh huh.' \\\"Anyway, we have a long way to go, and I'm excited to see what this year holds.\\\"\nWe walked up the entrance steps towards the bulletin boards containing the list of Classes and divisions. I hoped that our other friends, Ginette Valentine and Zenia Ingressia, would be in the same class as me and Seraphina, although the prospect of all four of us being together was unlikely. \nBoyish laughter echoed in the morning air, adding to the atmosphere of excitement and the overall cheeriness of the sunny day. I glanced at the group of boys crowded around the bulletin board. It was Clair De Lune's basketball team, clad in their red and white uniforms. All of them were tall, exuding an aura of assurance and popularity. I glanced at them suddenly, and at one of them in particular, feeling a little bit breathless. What is this strange feeling? \nJust then, as I was still staring their way, a tall, slender girl, with an untouchable 'Queen-of-the-world' aura about her stepped up to talk to the boys, and I felt my heart plummet in uneasiness. It was strange, to say the least. \\\"Am I nervous?\\\" I wondered. But there wasn't any reason to feel nervous, right? I recognized her immediately by her long, straight black hair; she was Arctia Magellan, the social butterfly of the Academy, the most popular girl on campus, and an extremely talented Mage at that. Also, extremely mean too, if the rumours were anything to go by. But she hadn't bothered me, and I didn't know any of the basketball members either. So then, why...?\n\\\"He's really handsome, isn't he?\\\" Seraphina's voice whispered in my ear, and I flinched. Was I that obvious?\n\\\"Who are you talking about?\\\" Faking ignorance, I pretended to look around. \n\\\"There!\\\" She inclined her head towards someone, and I followed her gaze to see who she was referring to.\n\\\"Oh. Yeah, yes, he is kind of cute.\\\" It wasn't him. \nA sudden wild, crazy idea sprouted in my mind. I stepped forward, not really knowing what came over me. What if I just throw caution to the winds and maybe...maybe...?\nNo. Stop. What was I doing? I let out a breath, re-centring my thoughts. For a fleeting second, why did it feel like I was being pulled to him? That's.....just my overactive imagination. 'Don't shatter your glass when you've just bought it, Carnation,' I mentally warned myself. \nAt that point however, Ginette and Zenia came up, along with a bunch of our other classmates, and in the excitement of finding out our divisions and everything, the incident faded away out of my mind. But from that day onwards, I was always on the look-out for that handsome stranger I had seen, with the roguishly charming face. \nFirst day of my second year, huh. I have a feeling it's going to be eventful.\n\n\n\n"}

It's her fault we're at this bar to begin with. \nI roll my eyes and order another beer, thanking God that I decided to get a fake ID a few months ago. Not really sure if that's something I should necessarily be thanking God for, but I will anyways. The beer tastes like watered down piss, but it's better than standing here sober while my cousin and best friend, Cora Pritchett, attempts to get over her piece of shit ex-boyfriend I'm sure she'll get back together with tomorrow. \nI push the thought aside and smile at her, nudging her shoulder gently. \\\"He's staring at you, hot stuff. Go talk to him.\\\" I can't think of his name, but I do know that he's always flocked by the girls in the lecture hall of the class we share and would be the perfect rebound for Pritchett.\nPritchett scoffs, \\\"As if. Why don't you go talk to him?\\\"\n\\\"Because I don't want to. Tonight is about you.\\\"\n\\\"Al, it's also about getting you out of your comfort zone. Let's be realistic, that guy is out of both of our comfort zones. You should start giving guys a chance again instead of making judgement based on how hot they are.\\\"\nI take a long drink of my beer; she doesn't normally push me on this topic. \\\"Because guys like him are nothing but trouble. I mean Jesus Pritchett, just look at the guy. I bet he's had everything handed to him in life. You're hot enough to pull ones that look like him. Except you choose to go after losers like Eli.\\\"\n\\\"Oh I'm looking at him,\\\" She muses, ignoring my comment about Eli. They're so going to get back together tomorrow. I steal a glance over at the table he and a few other guys are sitting at. His mouth quirk upwards once we make eye contact and I grimace. \n\\\"Can I get two shots of vodka?\\\" I ask the bartender when I turn back around. Pritchett's right, tonight is also about getting me out of my comfort zone. Except this whole place is out of my comfort zone. \nI wanted to go to school in Texas, not stay in fucking Minnesota. \nI can hear my mom's voice in my head though, 'Free college is better than your first choice Alondra. Go there with an open mind. You could end up having the best time!'\nOpen mind my ass. \nThey have no idea why I wanted to leave. That'd require them being present in my life. \nI tilt my head back to take the shot when Pritchett nudges me, causing some of it to spill into my mouth before I'm ready. \\\"He's coming over here!\\\"\nThe liquor burns as it hits the wrong part of my throat and I cough trying to clear it as she looks at me confused, completely having missed what just happened. \\\"What's wrong with you?\\\" She hisses as the guy we've been talking about leans on the bar next to us. I wipe my chin dry with a napkin. \n\\\"Can I buy you ladies a drink?\\\" His voice is smooth and confident and I can see Pritchett practically melt. \n\\\"No thanks,\\\" I say at the same time Pritchett says yes.\nShe glares at me, \\\"Al, be nice!\\\"\nI paste a sickly sweet smile on my face, \\\"No thank you.\\\"\nThen he has the nerve to laugh. What a prick. \\\"Well Al, that was certainly nicer. What are you guys drinking?\\\" He asks, rewording his question in a different way.\n\\\"Vodka soda,\\\" Pritchett replies happily and I sigh.\n\\\"IPA.\\\" I admit reluctantly. \nHe looks amused and runs a hand through his chestnut colored hair, mussing it up in a perfectly imperfect way. I resist the way that simple movement causes my stomach to flip flop, ignoring my brain telling it to cut that shit out. The way he carries himself is dangerous, full of self assuredness. He's too much like my past mistakes.\n\nCollege is where I'm supposed to be smarter. Keep my head down, make some friends, focus on class. So far I've succeeded at all of the above.\nThe bartender brings two more drinks for us over and I down my other shot since Pritchett hasn't yet. I need it more than she does.\n\\\"I haven't seen two girls as pretty as you around here in a long time. What brings you to Twin City?\\\"\nAnd then Pritchett says something that about causes me to shove her off the barstool she's sitting on. \\\"Al is looking to get out of her comfort zone. I heard from a friend that Twin City is the bar to be at on campus so here we are.\\\"\nHis baby blue eyes shift to me, \\\"Oh is that right?\\\"\nI'm going to kill her.\nWe're rooming together so it should be fairly easy. Smother her with a pillow while she sleeps peacefully. She'd never see it coming.\nI don't bother responding, instead taking a sip of my drink. I can feel the effects of the first shot, combined with the beer I already had before that. I'm fine, but the second shot hasn't hit me yet. I need to be done before I make any stupid decisions.\nPritchett shoots me a smile and a quick wink. \\\"I'm going to go to the restroom. You'll keep an eye on her, won't you?\\\"\nFucking Cora Pritchett. I'm actually going to kill her. Tonight is about her finding someone to hook up with, not her hooking me up with someone.\n\\\"Cross my heart and hope to die.\\\"\nPritchett disappears and I resist the urge to bang my head on the counter. \\\"You can go back to your buddies, I'm not interested.\\\"\nInstead, he slides into the seat Pritchett had been occupying since she traitorously disappeared. \\\"I'm Jack. What does Al stand for?\\\"\n\\\"Well Jack, that's for me to know and you to figure out.\\\"\nI tap my fingers on the neck of the bottle, ignoring him as he studies me. \\\"I'm going to have to go with Allie?\\\" I think the disgust on my face proves his answer wrong without me needing to say anything. Jack laughs, \\\"Alex?\\\" I shrug indifferently because I don't plan on telling him my actual name but all this results in is him shifting closer to me. \\\"Well Alex, I think you're stunning.\\\"\nHe can't think this shit actually works. A short laugh escapes me, \\\"Does that line work on girls normally?\\\"\nHis smile grows, pleased that I actually responded. \\\"Usually. Lucky for you, I like the coy act too.\\\"\n\\\"It's not coy if I'm actually not interested.\\\" I point out to Jack because I'm not. \nHe's attractive. He's tan from summer still and built like he could bench two of me easily while not being too buff. Except Jack knows he's hot which isn't attractive. \n\\\"Darling, you're making me look bad in front of my friends.\\\" He teases and I take another drink of my beer.\n\\\"Boo hoo.\\\" He needs to get over himself.\nJack doesn't let my response deter him. \\\"My buddies will tease me endlessly if I have to leave you without a kiss at least. I have a feeling your friend isn't going to let you leave either unless she thinks something happened between us. So what do you say to getting out of your comfort zone and saving me from public humiliation? It's a win win situation.\\\"\nAs much as I don't want to admit he's right, I think that Jack is unfortunately right about Pritchett. She isn't going to leave until she's satisfied that I've stepped out of my comfort zone.\n\n\\\"Do your worst. One shot buddy,\\\" I reply, turning to face him as he steps off the stool to tower over me. I can blame this on the alcohol tomorrow. My stomach is flopping as his eyes drop to where I'm chewing on my lip. Nervous habit of mine. \nJack brushes some of my long brown hair out of my face tenderly and a part of me is surprised to realize that I might actually want him to kiss me. \\\"Darling, I wasn't pulling a line on you when I said you were stunning.\\\" His southern accent is rough, sending chills through my body.\n\\\"Sorry if I don't exactly believe you-\\\" I'm silenced by his mouth slanting confidently over mine. His lips move unhurriedly against my mouth and I can't help but lean into Jack as his tongue sweeps over my bottom lip. \nThis is one hundred percent because of the alcohol. My back is being pressed into the bar counter as I rest my hand on his chest, feeling the hardness of the muscles being hidden beneath it. \nI surprise myself again by opening my mouth, letting his tongue explore further. This might be one of the best kisses I've had.\n\n\n\n"}

A few hundred students representing 23 Bay Area schools had thrown on shirts, ties, dresses, necklaces, jackets and polished shoes and converged on quiet Mill Valley in woodsy Marin County to talk and talk and talk and maybe win a trophy. Two of those schools were Sonoma Valley High School, a small town/suburban school with about 1,300 students, and Sloat-Bushnell Country Day School, a modest-sized, century-old, prestigious K-12 private school housed in a bland 1950s-era building in San Francisco's quaint Noe Valley neighborhood.\nThe proper term for competitive scholastic speech events is forensics, but when you tell someone that you're going to a forensics tournament on Saturday, it sounds like you're competing to see who can perform autopsies and dust for fingerprints the quickest. So, alongside things like \\\"competitive speaking\\\" or \\\"speech and debate\\\", the word \\\"debate\\\" by itself is used most often. But \\\"debate\\\" covers a huge spectrum of event categories. If you want to engage in mouth-to-mouth combat with others, you have a buffet of choices: to debate one-on-one, there's Lincoln-Douglas (LD) Debate. If you'd rather have a partner and go up against other twosomes, there's Policy Debate (a single topic for all schools for a whole year, with tons of research), Public Forum Debate (the topic changes every few months) or Parliamentary Debate (a different topic each round). Or for larger groups there's Student Congress or Mock Trial.\nThen there are the individual events. You can write and memorize a speech (Oratory, Advocacy, Original Prose/Poetry), or perform a piece written by others (Humorous/Dramatic/Thematic/Oratorical/Duo Interpretation).\nThen there's the rare breed who have no fear of the uncertainty, spontaneity and sudden changes of life. For this group, there are two choices: Impromptu Speaking and Extemporaneous Speaking.\nThey have broad similarities: each round a speaker is given a choice of three topics. They then have a limited amount of time to compose a speech that's a few minutes long.\nFor Impromptu, you get abstract words or quotes or ideas and have two minutes to prepare a speech that can't be any longer than five minutes.\nFor Extemp (as it's universally called), you get three topics on current newsy things. Thirty minutes afterwards, you must give a coherent, intelligent (or at least a good fake of something intelligent) seven-minute speech, after having consulted news articles, journals, books or other official material. And even then you get your choice: National Extemp (trying to examine the stories you hear in the news every day in a way that seems original), or International Extemp (trying to convince people you're a pimply 16-year-old American who just happens to know a lot about the government situation in Belarus).\nImpromptu is always the event with the most competitors, since everyone thinks it's easy. Extemp is the event that attracts a unique bunch: smart, wonkish, eager at a chance for self-expression and confident in their own cleverness.\nNeil competed in National Extemp.\nExtempers are sequestered from the rest of the competition in the \\\"prep room\\\", usually a school's library or cafeteria. At a tournament each school gets its own table. Each school's extempers are a clique, with their own camaraderie, private jokes, and ways of killing time between rounds. There may be some limited interaction between schools, but the tribalism is a fierce obstacle to overcome.\n\n\n\n"}

It opens as he reaches it, and he strides out into the brisk air, careful not to spill his coffee. It's still early autumn, but a cold front had swept over the city last night, leaving its residents to dust off boxes of winter clothing that had been lying dormant on the top shelf of a closet all summer.\nCars whir by overhead; the faint hum of electric engines is drowned out by the bustle of people on the ground, chatting and hurrying about their days. Advertisements flash and flicker brightly on the sides of skyscrapers. Ahead of him, the giant towers of corporate buildings loom, their windows gleaming in the weak afternoon sun. Ghosts of the original city remain, too\u2014he glances down the street to his right and catches a glimpse of the night market at the end as he passes by. Now, it's mostly used for illicit trades and other business Jungwoo doesn't care to learn about, but before, when there was still an abundance of fresh crops, it had been a hub, a prime gathering spot for all the citizens of NeoCity to dance and drink and try exotic foods into the late hours of the night. Now, in the day, it lays dormant, gate rusted, tents covered in a layer of dust and grime.\nJungwoo looks up to his left as he exits the noisy shopping district. There's an old billboard, facing the main gates that lead to the outside world. The sign hasn't been tended to in many years, so the lettering is faint, and if Jungwoo didn't already know what it said, he isn't sure he'd even be able to make it out. To the world, welcome to NCity! The irony of the row of heavily armed guards stationed in front of the gates is not lost on him. He rakes his gaze over them quickly as he crosses into the business district.\nGenerations ago, NeoCity was flourishing. The parks were filled with beautiful plants; the farms had an abundance of food crops, as well as a small number of animals for consumption. The water was clean and pure; business was good, and so was tourism. \nBut then came years-long onslaughts of bad weather. Harsh, cold winters gave way almost instantly to scorching, dry summers, and then back again. Crops withered and died; sickness spread rapidly. Cities shut their gates to visitors. Wars broke out over natural resources. People everywhere were searching for someone to blame more than they were searching for solutions, so they didn't pay any mind to how they were polluting the earth. The soil became nearly entirely infertile. NeoCity only survived because it had very good tech and wise leaders. They expanded force field technology, and made a protective shield that ran over the walls and created a dome overhead. Communication with other civilizations is now not only impossible, but illegal, as it poses a security threat. Not that it matters anyway. As far as anyone knows, no one else survived. Those few who did don't live in societies, but are vagabonds, wandering and likely riddled with disease or poisoned by radiation. They don't let anybody in, and they're not allowed out, either. It's too dangerous. That's how it's been for eighty years.\nJungwoo cradles his coffee cup in both hands as he waits for the eye scanner to recognize him and unlock the doors of the office building. It's real coffee\u2014rare, but not completely out of stock\u2014not the powdered shit most stores sell. It's expensive, but that's not really why Jungwoo doesn't get it very often. He can certainly afford it, he just knows it's in short supply, and he doesn't want to hoard its consumption. So he only gets it on holidays or his birthday, or when he's just gotten a big project approved, and he needs to wrap up all his loose ends so he can send out his final results.\nIt's the latter today. The door opens and he heads inside, going straight to the elevators to take him back up to his office, sipping his coffee. He's set to roll out an update for their most recent droid model. Users had complained that their speech was choppy and sometimes didn't make sense, and he realized there'd been a bug when they'd downloaded language from their databases. Luckily, all droids are connected to the internet\u2014it's illegal for them not to be\u2014so once his update patch is tested and approved, they'll be able to upload the code and fix them all immediately. Also, then he'll be able to get back to the workshop instead of being trapped in front of his computer all day.\n\nHe plunks back down in his seat, and leans back, looking out the window. His dad is the CEO of the company\u2014Zeus Engineering, Inc., because his father has an interest in ancient mythologies, and also because Zeus is a play on Jungwoo's name\u2014so Jungwoo has a nice office with a view of the city. From here, he can see his apartment building on the other side of the shopping district. Beyond that, the suburbs, and then the rest is hard to make out, except for the growing towers of \\\"matchboxes\\\"\u2014tightly packed apartments built to be just enough. They quickly ran out of horizontal space, so they started building upwards. They're cheap, but very cramped.\nHe sighs, and turns his attention back to his computer, downing the rest of his coffee, which is rapidly cooling. Just a few more hours of work, and he can go see his friends. Being a real adult sucks, he thinks as he aims his empty cup at a nearby trash can, sending it sailing through the air. He misses.\n\nChapter 2\n\n17.00 finds him on his way out the door, scarf wound around his neck. The energy shield around the city protects from things like snow and wind, but not against the changing of temperatures. When they need it, the city officials will put a filter up and let the rain through in certain sectors to collect for drinking water. Luckily, today is just cold, so Jungwoo doesn't bother pulling out his phone to check where rainfall is scheduled.\nEveryone is out, so getting back to his place takes a little longer than usual. He weaves and dodges through the crowd, sidestepping messenger droids and almost getting his head taken off by a kid on a hoverboard. By the time he's walking up to his apartment building, it's almost 18.00, and Yukhei is already standing outside. Completely in contrast to Jungwoo's buttoned-up, business formal attire, Yukhei is in a pair of loose black pants, silver zippers flashing as he shifts his weight from leg to leg, and a white hoodie with angular stitching\u2014simple, and comfortable. Jungwoo's heart feels like it's vibrating in his chest. \nHe and Yukhei\u2014they're not dating, but they're certainly something. They just haven't really talked about it yet. He's kinda hoping they will tonight\u2014he's having Yukhei and a few others over, but he knows they'll go home early, and Yukhei will probably stay.\n\\\"Sorry,\\\" Jungwoo says in lieu of a greeting when he draws near. \\\"It's crazy out there. Everyone's already out for the night.\\\" He turns to scan in as Yukhei peels himself off the wall, laughing.\n\\\"You know, if you'd just get a car,\\\" he points out. \\\"You could get here in like five minutes flat.\\\"\n\\\"I don't want to bother with parking,\\\" Jungwoo says, beckoning Yukhei in and following after. \n\\\"Okay, trust fund. I'm just saying some of us would love a car.\\\"\n\\\"I can get you a car,\\\" Jungwoo offers as they step into the elevator. Yukhei rolls his eyes, shaking his head.\n\\\"No, thank you. I'm happy on my scooter. At least I know what it wants from me,\\\" he says. \\\"Since I built it.\\\"\n\\\"And it didn't even take another finger from you.\\\" Jungwoo nods at the metal prosthetic. Yukhei makes a fist, watching the reflections it casts on the wall. He sliced his left ring finger off early on in his mechanics training, and Jungwoo had helped him build and wire a replacement.\nThe elevator dings gently, and they step off, strolling down the hall to Jungwoo's unit. He groans as soon as the door is shut, struggling out of his coat and fumbling with the ties on his corset vest. \\\"Finally,\\\" he says. \\\"This thing has been suffocating me all day.\\\"\nYukhei just laughs, coming up behind him and batting his hands away. Jungwoo lets his arms fall to his sides, sighing as Yukhei unlaces the corset, loosening it to the top and pulling it up over Jungwoo's head. He smooths down Jungwoo's shirt, big hands warm against Jungwoo's waist. \\\"I know you all like to dress very proper,\\\" he comments, \\\"but you could go for something a little less... cramp-inducing? Asphyxiating?\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

I slammed shut my Pride and Prejudice hardcover, and strode back to the locked door.\n\\\"Ames, how long do you need to apply your stupid mascara?\\\" I groaned and wiggled the knob.\nThe bathroom door jerked open as I raised my hand to bang on it. Amy's smug smirk welcomed me inside. I stared at her, gaping at the black smokey eyes and the holes on her The Pretty Reckless T-shirt. However, I had ten minutes tops to take a shower and get dressed before the guests' scheduled arrival. We, Cambodians, were punctual to a fault, leaving me nowhere near enough time to discuss that punk rock attire.\nHer finger jabbed me in the ribs, but she strode to her bedroom before I could counterattack, yelling, \\\"There's no more hot water. Happy birthday, sucker.\\\"\nUrgh.\nI deposited my smelly clothes into the laundry basket. I didn't regret offering to help my father pre-fry the spring rolls, but now, I smelt of ground pork, fish sauce, and sunflower oil. A delicious fragrance, yet not one suitable for a birthday party--all the more so my own. I stepped into the cabin, and squealed as the icy water froze my brain, hunching over in a desperate attempt at reducing the quantity of cold water drenching my buttocks.\n\\\"It's good for your wrinkles,\\\" Amy screamed from the hallway, rushing to go downstairs.\n\\\"I'm twenty,\\\" I shouted back, my teeth chattering together, \\\"and you're only two years younger.\\\"\nMy hands worked the shampoo on my scalp while goosebumps crept up my skin. I sucked in a deep breath before rinsing my hair, then my shaking knees made me stumble on the bathmat as I wrapped myself in a towel. Cursing Amy and her never-ending showers, I shuffled with the mat to pry the window open and let in the evening warmth of Quebec summer. A hot draft invaded the room, along with the scent of the honeysuckle my mother had planted all around the house. \nThe doorbell warned me of the first arrivals when I was putting the finishing touches on my makeup. By the time I arranged my still damp hair in a crown, twelve adults and five kids flooded the house.\nThe dining room was stuffy yet comfy, the two tables we had arranged allowing us to move around yet still chat all together. Dad, who was choking on wasabi peanuts, fought with my younger cousins over the television remote. Near the wood stove, his elder sister was bragging about my cousin Edward, and Mom nodded at her every word, patiently waiting for her turn to boast about her daughters' achievements. Amy, and one of my friends from uni, Idris, were arguing about the latest James Bond movie, while setting the table with special occasions dishware.\nI toured the guests, getting my cheeks sniffed here and pinched there, as per Cambodian tradition, until my father clapped his hands. \\\"Dinner's ready. Tonight, the chef offers a selection of spring rolls, samosas, and shrimp toasts, lemongrass beef skewers, caramelised pork belly rolls, chicken lot cha, and Cantonese rice.\\\"\nMy youngest cousins darted to the fried delicacies, burning their fingers and tongues on the crispy brik pastry. The adults deployed around the tables, working together on a production line to drop off a sample of each dish into each plate.\n\\\"Are those pork skewers the same as last month, Mr. Chey?\\\" Idris drooled over the rolls as he disposed them over white rice, his baby blue gaze lingering on the plate leaving his hands.\n\\\"Yes, except I doubled the quantity of minced shallots to strengthen the flavour. And please, call me Uncle.\\\" My father extended his arms to indicate everyone. \\\"In Cambodia, everyone is family.\\\"\n\nAs the initial commotion settled and the guests sat down to attack the meal, my eyes wandered from Amy, who was slipping one of her precious fried breadsticks to the baby, to Mom's brother, who was already gnawing on his third skewer.\nYes, this was family.\nAn hour later, as dinner ended and everybody was in a food coma, Mom asked, her hands on my shoulders, \\\"Ready for the cake?\\\"\nI let my head fall backwards, and grinned at her reversed face. She dropped a Cambodian kiss on my forehead, her ruby curls tickling my chin. I closed my eyes in delight as she pressed her nose against my skin, and sniffed it softly. Would I ever get over this ancestral mark of affection? What could be more tender and adoring than inhaling the clean, perfect scent of your loved ones? When Mom stepped away to look for a lighter, I did not regret taking the time to shower after cooking.\nAuntie herded the youngest kids around me while Dad switched off the lights. From the kitchen, Amy's shrill voice started singing the birthday song, quickly followed by the rest of my family and friends. She strode, our mother's much shorter legs straining to keep up, and they placed a three-layer chocolate cake in front of me. As the song was brought to an end, Amy soloed the last \\\"to you\\\", so off-key that the neighbours' dog howled back from their garden.\nWhile everyone whooped in laughter, I took a deep breath and blew all the candles, wishing for good health, success in my studies, and maybe love for the year to come.\n\\\"The present, the present!\\\" Edward chanted, reminding me that I had no idea what my gift would be this year, but that they all pitched in together.\nAmes darted to the kitchen, and came back hiding something behind her. \\\"Close your eyes and hold out your hands.\\\"\nI obeyed, but not without shooting her a warning look. This better not be sticky. Or hot. Or sticky and hot.\nShe dropped a light, cubic, room-temperature and non-sticky object in my palm. I opened my eyes, eager to discover the surprise that my classmates were taunting me about for the past weeks.\nA black leather case, not bigger than a jewelry box, was resting in my hand. Two circles were embossed on its lid, overlapping to form an infinity symbol. I traced it with my index, then opened my present.\nInside, a single silvery disc glinted, catching the light of the candles on my birthday cake, that Auntie kept rekindling for my cousins' pleasure.\n\\\"Uhm... thank you?\\\" What the heck was I holding? I plastered an unconvincing grin on my face.\nEdward snorted. \\\"You really need to get your head out of your books.\\\"\n\\\"I don't spend that much time reading.\\\"\n\\\"Yes, you do,\\\" Amy muttered.\n\\\"Oy. I know this is my birthday, but can we slow down on compliments?\\\" I grimaced.\nShe blew a raspberry in answer.\n\\\"It's a Bridge,\\\" Edward continued. He turned his head to show a similar disc on his temple. \\\"You put it on your skin to get the ultimate virtual-reality experience.\\\"\n\\\"It's like a video game, except it looks and feels real,\\\" Idris added. \\\"InfiCorp takes existing stories--movies, TV shows, books--and turns them into 3D worlds.\\\"\n\\\"Okay.\\\" I frowned. Why would they think I'd enjoy this device?\nThe room stayed silent, all eyes on me while my friends and my family waited for realisation to dawn on me. Only the baby was oblivious to the tension, her little hand fumbling on her father's dessert plate to grab a piece of cut fruit.\n\nIdris repeated, \\\"Movies, TV shows, books. Books.\\\"\n\\\"Don't tell me...\\\" I muttered, unable to finish my sentence.\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Mom confirmed, while pouring champagne into flutes, and handing me the first one.\n\\\"No way,\\\" I gasped.\n\\\"Yes way.\\\" Amy's face splitted with a satisfied grin.\n\\\"Oh, my God.\\\" I jumped to my feet, squealing with delight. \\\"Is it a Pride and Prejudice edition?\\\"\n\\\"The Elizabeth version,\\\" Idris clarified.\nDad chortled and rubbed his salt-and-pepper goatee. \\\"Happy birthday, pumpkin.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, thank you. Thank you all for this wonderful gift.\\\"\n\\\"Thank Amy,\\\" Auntie chided in. \\\"She's the one that talked us into pooling together to get you this Bridge.\\\"\nI grabbed my sister's hand before she could flee, wrapping her in my arms and smooching her cheek repeatedly. \\\"How can I ever repay you, dearest Amy?\\\"\nShe wiggled away from my embrace and huffed, \\\"You could stop monopolising the television to watch Colin Firth's wet T-shirt contest.\\\"\nLater that evening, I laid on my bed, the little leather box opened on my belly and its manual within my hands.\nBy using this Bridge, I hereby authorize InfiCorp to access my five senses.\n\n\n\n\n"}

I gasped, before realizing my silliness and stepping closer to the mirror. I let my hands glide over the pastel green muslin dress, admiring the high-waisted skirt that was cut as one with the bodice and flattered her figure.\nThe straight, full-length sleeves indicated I was wearing a morning gown from the end of the eighteenth century, matching the period Jane Austen wrote the first draft of her novel. A large, white handkerchief covered my crossover neckline with embroidered lace, modestly concealing the cleavage.\nI swayed, revelling in the rustling of the silk petticoat. The movement drew my attention to the lower part of my body, and I froze in wide-eyed bewilderment. I brushed my back with caution, my hands asserting what my buttocks already knew. Holy moly, I had no panties.\nTechnically, I was not naked under my gown. Drawers protected my thighs while allowing business to be done--a breeze between my legs confirmed it. Stays supported my bustline, turning my torso into a stiff, inverted cone, and a shift shielded me from the fully-boned garment. I raised my hand to identify its fabric, blushing at the touch of the soft bosom that was definitely more generous than my real one.\nLetters appeared from thin air, hanging in front of my eyes no matter where I looked. The Bridge manifested itself, asking for my attention.\nWould you like to keep this appearance, or load your own?\nOh, that was a tough one. I weighed the pros and the cons of customising my character. Would I rather live the story as a Caucasian girl, with fair skin, chestnut hair, and those weird frizzy curls that kept tickling my cheekbones?\nOr should I stick to my own appearance, sun-kissed skin, straight raven hair, lanky arms, and almond-shaped eyes? Would it be weird for the other characters to have an Asian lady strolling through Longbourn and Pemberley? Would they even notice? Would it affect the storyline?\nAfter this intense inner debate, I decided on the second option. If the device offered its user the possibility to load their appearance, it surely meant that the artificial intelligence, or whatever controlled the game, was able to handle any physical feature.\n\\\"My own, please.\\\"\nA snort so powerful came out through my nose that its vibrations reverberated to my ears. Irrepressible laughter filled the corridor as I hunched over, ears burning from merriness.\n\\\"C-can you disable the English accent, please?\\\" I asked breathily, unable to spend the whole story with this refined diction.\nAccent switched to Canadian English.\nA hand against the wall to keep balance, I dropped the hat and massaged my sore, hardened abdomen, fits of giggles shaking my body from time to time, until I managed to regain countenance. With a last chuckle, I straightened myself up, wiped a tear, and read the new words.\nDo you confirm that you read and agreed to the terms and conditions?\nI promised myself I would dutifully study the instruction manual after a good night's sleep. \\\"Sure.\\\"\nElizabeth Bennet rippled in the mirror, like a reflection on a small water pond. In the blink of an eye, I replaced her in the pale green gown. I smiled goofily at my familiar traits, wiggling my brows up and down. My grin widened as I cupped my breasts, whispering to them, \\\"I love you, girls, no matter your size.\\\"\nIn the evening room, Mrs. Bennet scoffed, bringing my attention back to the story. I bowed down to pick up the bonnet, then squared my shoulders and cleared my throat, working up the courage to meet, well, my family. With a last glance at the mirror, I patted my head, wishing I had something to try and bring some life into my stupid, sleek mane. Eighteen century fashion was not the best match for my Asian hair.\n\n\n\n"}

However, the only doctor near the Hertfordshire village of Ashwood charged about a month's wages for a house call. \nDoctor Carlton had a merciful reputation, and he thankfully had only charged Grace a small fee for her mother's care. \n\\\"I am only sorry I could not do more to help,\\\" replied Doctor Carlton regretfully. \\\"Your mother must stay in bed and rest that leg. She is not to walk on it. Not for two months at least. I shall return then to check on her. Are you to care for her?\\\" \nGrace shook her head. \\\"No. My younger sister, Claire, whom you met upstairs. She is to stay home and tend Mama. I would ordinarily be at my employer's this minute ... but alas ...\\\" \nDoctor Carlton held up his hand. \\\"Not to worry. I am certain your sister is more than up to the task. You have my address in London. Please do not hesitate to write.\\\" Placing his hat atop his greying tight curls, the doctor bowed his head. \\\"Good day, Miss Denham.\\\"\n\\\"Good day, Doctor,\\\" replied Grace with a small smile, and she closed the door. Exhaling, she leaned against the timber frame, and her eyes ran over the room before her.\nThe mending was piling up. The laundry had not been done. The breakfast dishes were still dirty. Bread had not been made. And those were only the downstairs chores. Upstairs were bedrooms full of dusting work and laundry that had not been attended to. \nGrace's seventeen-year-old sister, Claire, usually tended to the house, and had done so on her own since their middle sister Kate had married a year earlier. But Claire's time had been greatly occupied by their mother, and the household chores had not been a priority. \nGrace quickly returned to her mother's bedroom upstairs, where Claire was tending to her mother\u2019s broken leg. \nMrs Ellen Denham smiled at her eldest child as she entered the room and held her hand out for Grace. Grace sat down on the edge of the bed and put her hand in her mother's. \nMrs Denham was a lovely lady, with a rounded face and figure and a kind constitution. She had aged in her face, and her dark hair had greyed, in the last five years since Mr Denham had passed away. \nWhen her father died, both Grace and Mrs Denham had found employment as housemaids with the wealthy Slickson family; a landed family in a neighbouring village. It was where they had remained employed until Mrs Denham had taken a fall down a flight of stairs and had snapped a bone in her lower leg. \nWere it not for Doctor Carlton, her leg might have been removed.\nBut without their mother's income, Grace's would not be enough to live on. Her meagre wage would not feed her mother, and her three siblings still at home. Her fifteen-year-old brother, Peter, hardly made a wage as a blacksmith's apprentice, and were it not be for Jim Ellis being their brother-in-law, and Kate's husband, they would not have been able to afford him that. \nJem was the youngest, at twelve years old, and much like Grace at that age, he was much too concerned with being a child, and Grace did not have the heart to ask him to give that up.\n\n\n\n"}

His hair, neatly cropped around his face, helped the limited light to exaggerate the sharp features of his face. What little movements he made were carefully drawn. Commander Hu Waan Vuke did not like to make mistakes before his superiors.\n\\\"Two years,\\\" the worn old man on the screen said, his face twisting due to the bad connection. The fault was on his end. Vuke's systems were flawless, he knew, thanks to his team. He paid his people well for their fine services and they never let him down.\n\\\"Two years, yes,\\\" Vuke said - perhaps with a little too much edge to his voice. He made sure to soften his tone as he continued. \\\"You promised at the end of two years that I would be a very rich man. I'm sure you aware of just how long has passed since we made our agreement.\\\"\n\\\"I don't forget things lightly,\\\" the old man countered. Vuke thought he noticed the figure's face twitch, but he could not be sure of anything he saw thanks to the connection. What he heard, however, was another matter.\n\\\"Nevertheless, I shall remind you. You have six months left, Governor, then my deal with you is over. You will pay me in full, as agreed. It is your choice whether you make your move with my aid or not. I don't mind sitting out on the action.\\\" Vuke silently hoped his contract with this man would not be renewed. He had agreed to help the Governor not because of his cause - no, Vuke cared nothing for his cause - but for the money the old man had promised.\nIf there was one thing Vuke appreciated, it was money. The more of them the merrier. Being a commander in the Celestial Watch paid him poorly for the effort his work required and Vuke did not enjoy spending his days chasing after petty crooks or patrolling the barren edges of his designated region. When he did find time to settle down and relax, there was always another enemy of the Watch to chase or some royal who needed an escort between cities.\nVuke hated royals. Hated them all from one end of the galaxy to the other. He had dined with few of them, spoken with more over the radio system of his cruiser. They were all the same. Stuck-up, soft-skinned rich folk with more money than Vuke liked to think about. He would not have minded them, not really, had he been just as rich. But Vuke had no royal blood in his veins. His mother had captained a cargo ship, his father just a wandered, both without money to their names.\nVuke would not be like them. He would not be another name tossed into the black void, never to be uttered again after his body was gone. He would not be another forgotten face.\n\\\"We will be ready to move soon,\\\" the old man was saying, his body reduced to a messy scatter of pixels on the screen. \\\"Our station is almost complete.\\\"\n\\\"Yes, the station. I was wondering about that.\\\" Vuke sat back in his chair. There had been few pieces of information shared between him and his newest associate. All Vuke knew was the Governor was building some form of station in the furthest reaches of his city's territory. The man had claimed it would help his people, but in what way Vuke was still unaware.\n\\\"All you have to do is make sure my people don't get caught up with the Watch.\\\" The man's words were clipped, his accent doing nothing to help make him seem threatening. Vuke had always found the Governor's voice to be like his first Celestial Watch instructor's. He had mocked his teacher until the day the poor fellow had crashed his ship into the Watch's mobile headquarters.\n\\\"You keep saying this,\\\" Vuke said with a wave of his hand. \\\"But I wonder when I will be needed to do so. So far all you have done is gather resources for this station.\\\"\nMetal and scraps - nothing out of the ordinary, even in the bulks of which the Governor and his people were buying and transporting them - were no concern of the Celestial Watch. Vuke had not even been forced to intervene with the massive cargo vessels when they had crossed through the regions guarded by the strictest of commanders. There was nothing criminal about legally buying building materials. If it was not criminal, there was no crime, and no need for Vuke to get involved.\nStill, Vuke knew something was going on with these people. For what need would an honest man need to bribe a Watch commander to look out for him? Furthermore, how did someone like the Governor, who could barely manage to afford a suitable communication connection, find the money to pay for all his ventures?\nSince agreeing to the contract, Vuke had worried the old man would be playing him. But all he had seen the Governor do was spend money, thousands tossed this way and that. Vuke did not mind where the credits came from, so he did not pry into the matter. He knew what he needed to - the Governor had money and he was willing to spend.\n\\\"The station is not your concern, my friend.\\\" A crackle cut through the voice, losing his next words. Vuke sat up in his chair and counted the moments until the old man returned. \\\"What you should be thinking about is how you will invest all that you are about to be granted. I presume you have grand plans?\\\"\nVuke smiled. He could see his future residence before him; a mansion house in the centre of a grand city, staff tending to the endless gardens and a fine vessel parked in a private landing strip. He would become a governor himself in time, once he had the correct funds. Then, with a city faction under his control, he would inscribe his name on every monument, never to be forgotten.\n\\\"Oh, yes,\\\" Vuke said. \\\"I have some ideas.\\\"\nA final crackle came from the screen, then the call ended and Vuke was bathed in darkness, that wicked smile still on his lips.\n\n\n\n"}

He is travelling through space with his family.\n\n#royalty, #aliens, #prince #scifi #space #family\n\nSpace Royalty\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nKael had spent his whole life in space, and he was starting to get bored of it.\nPlanets, spaceships, and moons were an everyday sight. Stars, beautiful though they were, had become a nuisance to him, there uneven light frustrating during the darker hours. The sound of nothing but the whoosh of shuttles passing by sent him to sleep at night. Space was a funny place, so crammed with wonderful things yet so empty at the same time.\nBorn under the setting star of T'ol, Prince Kael Galtionie had been gifted a good start in life. T'ol was the guardian star, the granter of safe passage through the systems. His birth under the constellation was a sign he was going to be a great king.\nThe Prince of Uterca sat back. He cocked his head, inspecting the last power tank he had adapted. Inside the glass chamber particles of electricity shot back and forth, the tiny cells casting a hazy glow over Kael's skin.\nCautiously he bit his lip and flipped a switch. The tank's particles changed from blue to white as they reactivated. Behind him the engine of the generator churned, coming back to life. Kael glanced out the only window in the tiny room to find the garden lights illuminated for the first time in weeks.\n\\\"What a smart boy.\\\"\nAt the sound of his sister's chirp voice, Kael turned. Nona stood in the doorway with her hands on her hips, a bright smile on her face. Unlike Kael, she had inherited their father's red hair and golden skin.\n\\\"Close the door!\\\" He got to his feet quickly and ushered her further into the room. He did not miss her eye-roll at the sheets of paper covering the floor. Nona kicked aside a few of his pencils as she surveyed the room.\nShe was wearing a red satin dress \u2013 one their mother would most certainly not approve of \u2013 and had tied a matching ribbon in her hair. A pair of heavy earrings chimed quietly when she rolled her neck. Her outfit screamed for attention while Keal's begged to be ignored. He wore a simple pale tunic tucked into his pants and white boots. If it was practical, Kael was more than willing to wear it. If it was loud and overly expensive, Nona would snatch it with her long-nailed fingers.\n\\\"Calm down, no one is going to find us here. This is the,\\\" she paused and screwed up her face, \\\"lower quarters of the palace.\\\"\n\\\"What do you mean find us?\\\"\n\\\"Come on, don't pretend those stupid Nor people are fun to hang out with.\\\"\nKael sighed and started packing his tools away. \\\"Mother is going to explode when neither of us turns up.\\\"\nQueen Telion Galitonie insisted her two children attended the Assembly of Nor in preparation for their later career. Although Kael did not detest listening to other city's ambassadors, he did find a great many things more interesting - such as the broken power generator he had just finished patching up.\nThe Assembly was the only political gathering of its size. A member of each of the cities would present reports of their economy and standing and any other relevant information they desired. Trade deals were the main concern of the Assembly, but often other issues such as city boundaries would crop up.\nWhile the other cities of space were happy to have ambassadors attend the Assembly on behalf of their kings and queens, Telion insisted she had no need for messengers. Uterca was the biggest and the best, she always said, therefore its queen had no reason to hide behind pawns.\nAs not much happened during these meetings other than petty arguments, Kael and his sister had made a simple deal. Kael would sit through every second gathering and Nona would have the afternoon to herself. In return, Nona would attend the meetings he did not.\n\nIn theory, their system of taking turns worked. Telion would favour whichever one of them sat with her for the day, and after a scolding from their mother whoever did not attend would be left alone.\nNona, however, did not enjoy sacrificing two hours of her day for Kael. She would much rather spend the rest of her life avoiding their mother than keep up her end of the deal. Kael had lost count of how many times she had refused to take her turn in the deep end.\nToolbox in hand, Kael stormed from the generator room and marched along the golden corridors of his home. Nona's steps did not follow. Kael refused to let himself turn back for his sister. He found a steady pace and tried not to think about his mother's anger, focusing his eyes on the guards lined along the hallyways.\nThe palace of Uterca was grand and finely decorated place; the floors a mix of marble and bronze carpeting, the brick walls covered in tiny gemstones and chandeliers hanging from the high tiled ceilings. It was the oldest building in the city, betting the central temple to the title by a single day. Kael's family had dwelled in the palace since the moment it had been completed.\nHe stopped between the twin staircases in the grand entrance hall and set his box down. \\\"I am in need of an escort for the princess,\\\" he told the gold-clad guard standing at the bottom of the steps. \\\"You may find her in lower levels. Please have her brought to the conference hall.\\\"\nThe big guard's lips turned upward as he bowed, and Kael could have sworn he saw Myteor Deloci wink at him.\n\\\"It will be done at once,\\\" Myteor said. A stamp of his foot signified the order had been accepted.\nKael pushed his fair hair from his face and hurried to the exit, straightening his jacket as he went.No less than thirty minutes later, in the conference hall at the other end of the city, Kael sat beside Nona and mother. Telion and Nona were engaged in a verbal battle concerning the latter's behaviour, Myteor hovering close behind with his hands clasped on the broad hilt of his sword.\nShrinking in his chair, Kael scanned the other faces at the table. The foreign ambassadors shared his lack of enthusiasm for his mother's nit-picking of Nona's outfit. One man, thin and balding with a grey beard, was not even looking at the queen; instead, he watched his wine swirl around his glass.\n\\\"If I may,\\\" Kael pipped up, his voice quiet and unheard by everyone other than his family. \\\"We can talk about this another time. Some of our guests have travelled halfway across the galaxy to be here.\\\"\nShould space have become a person instead of a place, Kael was sure it would have looked like his mother. A tall and narrow woman, Queen Telion Galtionie rose from her seat with grace. Her purple skin, which both her children had failed to inherit, shimmered, and the beads on her gown knocked against each other with a soft click.\n\\\"Bored of my talk, Ambassador Lezorith?\\\" she locked her grey eyes onto the man playing with his wine. He stopped, placed the glass on the table, and got to his feet.\n\\\"Only enjoying the supplements.\\\" Lezorith lowered himself back down, clearly not enjoying the attention which had been suddenly cast upon him. The ambassador came from a lesser city.

There weren't too many of us in our industry, so there was only a single bathroom in the entire building for us, and every single woman was also categorized right in with me. The engineers, the pit crew workers, and the money of each individual operation, none of them had faces for the public's eye. Only I did.\nDid I want that responsibility? Hell no, because there had to be a better face somewhere out there, but we had to roll with what we had. And unfortunately for us, that was me, the only female driver in NASCAR's Cup Series.\nI watched as other crew members rushed past, explaining things to each other in terms I could never dream of understanding. All I did was drive the car.\nI took a swig of water.\nOf course, I had just finished peeing when the NASCAR officials caught me for another mandatory random test for drugs and other fun illegal substances. It was absolutely incredible that they somehow managed to accomplish that feat five fucking weeks in a row.\nImportant-sounding shoes clicked down the hall, and the most important man around the garage emerged from around the corner.\n\\\"Would you like to hear your to-do list for today?\\\" a female voice asked.\n\\\"Let's hear it, Rebecca,\\\" Mr. Roger Truscott, the team owner and, more importantly, my boss said. He paused when he saw me. \\\"Actually, hold off on the list. Miss Moore, how are you?\\\"\n\\\"Well, I'm getting piss-tested again, so the same as usual, I guess,\\\" I replied.\n\\\"Perhaps if you'd lay off the social web and Snapagram, this wouldn't be a problem for you and your lifestyle,\\\" Mr. Truscott said. \nHe tugged at the cuff of his button-down and revealed the newest addition to his collection of watches, a golden one with a few diamonds integrated in a scattered pattern. Other than the color, every watch he owned looked the same to me, but what did I know about flaunting one's wealth and ego?\nI scowled. \\\"I've been clean this whole time, and I'll be clean this time. You know, this is the seventh time this season that I've been randomly selected, and Griffin's been selected exactly zero. I'm not trying to say it's bullshit, but\u2014\\\"\n\\\"That's exactly what you're trying to say. Stop complaining and just provide the urine sample, and when you're finished, I need to see you in my office to discuss your car for next week. Rebecca, the list.\\\"\nHe and Rebecca continued their walk down the hall, and Rebecca read from the list. \\\"On your agenda today, you're meeting Griffin about the adjustments he wants on his car from last year's race.\\\" Her heels clicked the ground as she continued her list.\nIf I wasn't tied to the chair until I provided the desired sample, I would have followed him straight down the hall and kicked the self-righteous old man's ass, but that was also a great way to get myself suspended for a few races at the very minimum.\nInstead, I was stuck with my stubborn ass bladder and my thoughts.\nI let out a sigh.\nI wasn't exactly sure what Mr. Truscott wanted to discuss with me about my car, but the conversation usually involved me suggesting improvements and him telling me that I had to deal with what I had. I knew the drill at this point, and I tried not to deviate from the script we had set.\nIf I could just get one win under my belt, maybe he'd finally give me what I wanted, no questions asked.\nI downed the rest of the water bottle in my hand, and I headed into the restroom with my special urine sample cup labeled with masking tape and my name. I hated peeing in those cups since I always managed to get it all over my hand, but rules were rules, even if they were incredibly ridiculous.\n\nAfter I finished and gave my sample away to be tested, I hobbled into Mr. Truscott's office that drowned in humidity in the early Louisiana summer. Although he didn't have too many things on his to-do list for the day, I had plenty. I had some track simulations to do for the upcoming race at Talladega, an interview with the hosts of NASCAR Tonight, a weekly program for die-hard fans, and a party to celebrate the last victory of my teammate and best friend, Griffin Gallagher.\nMostly I just cared about the party, though.\nI knocked on the door to Mr. Truscott's office, and when he called for me to come in, I sat down across from him at his desk.\n\\\"So what kind of bullshit are you going to make me listen to this week?\\\" I asked. I crossed my legs and smiled. Power move.\n\\\"I didn't ask you to sit, Moore,\\\" he replied.\nThe burns and blisters on my feet from the intense heat of the brake during the last race were still fresh, and standing simply wasn't an option for me. I blinked a couple times. \\\"Well, you'll just have to deal with this.\\\"\nRoger Truscott took in a breath. \\\"Very well. The reason I called you in here was to talk about your sponsor and paint scheme for the Talladega race this Sunday.\\\"\n\\\"Did Goodyear quit on me? Because otherwise, I don't see how\u2014\\\"\nHe interrupted me. \\\"No, they're still your primary sponsor, but since this weekend marks the anniversary of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous, your car will be decorated to celebrate that.\\\"\nI rose my eyebrows. \\\"Alcoholics Anonymous? You can't be serious.\\\"\n\\\"Do you have a problem with that fine organization?\\\"\n\\\"No, but then everyone's going to think that I'm an alcoholic. I can't associate myself and my career with something like that.\\\"\n\\\"Don't be ridiculous. You have to be the one to drive the AA car. Can you please remind me where you're from?\\\"\nI knew where this was going. \\\"Akron, Ohio.\\\"\n\\\"And where was AA founded?\\\"\nI shook my head. \\\"Please don't do this to me. I don't want to drive the fucking Alcoholics Anonymous car. It's like I'm promoting drinking and driving, which is bad.\\\"\n\\\"You don't have a choice. I'm telling you that since you're their hometown hero, you have to drive that car.\\\"\n\\\"What about LeBron James? He's from Akron, but no one ever asks him to drive an AA car.\\\"\n\\\"That most likely has something to do with the fact that he plays basketball,\\\" a voice said from behind me. I turned around in my chair, and there stood Griffin.\nHe was quite the character, and it seemed that every little aspect of his personality and story made it onto his skin as a tattoo. His first race victory appeared as a checkered flag wrapped around a trophy, his Game of Thrones obsession was pictured with a dragon, and there were also the matching roses we drunkenly got together. Combined with his dark, puppy-like eyes and a beard, it made for an overall appearance that I didn't mind having as a teammate, and more importantly, a friend.\nI smiled. \\\"Alright, you made your point. Get the fuck out of here now.\\\"\nGriffin pulled out the chair next to me and sat down. \\\"Come on, Katie. Don't be dramatic for once in your life. It's good publicity for a good group.\\\" He turned to Mr. Truscott. \\\"Sorry I'm late for my meeting, Roger. I got a little caught up in other things.\\\"\n\\\"Hot girl?\\\" I asked.\nGriffin nodded. \\\"So hot.\\\"\n\\\"You're an hour late, Griffin. You can't keep doing this,\\\" Mr. Truscott said. \\\"I was in the middle of discussing Miss Moore's car with her, which I had to begin late because someone needed her urine sampled again.\\\"\n\n\\\"Again? Fuck, Kate, they've probably taken half of your body weight in piss at this point,\\\" Griffin said.\nI shrugged. \\\"What can I do about it? Nothing.\\\"\n\\\"Seriously. There's no way that she's gotten picked randomly this many times in one season. It's not possible,\\\" Griffin said, and I nodded.\n\\\"It's possible, just not statistically likely,\\\" Mr. Truscott said.\nGriffin leaned back in his chair and rolled his eyes. \\\"Bullshit.\\\"\n\\\"I appreciate the backup, but you seriously need to get out of my meeting. We're discussing confidential information, and you can't know about it. I'm still trying to beat you to the finish line at the end of the day,\\\" I said.\n\n\n\n"}

A crackling energy that made his intestines twist and his palms sweat. He'd heard the traveling bards describe love as butterflies, but this was no gentle flutter. Fire, he thought again. Flames and smoke and damnation. Because that's what would happen if he ever acted on this burning lustfulness.\nYet, out of the half-dozen taverns where Marin could have stopped for a midday meal, this is where he ate. Every day. It was torture, but he couldn't help himself. Despite his vows of celibacy, despite the promise he made to his father, despite the impossibility of love rooted in his malformed body, despite everything, he had been infatuated with Jocelyn since the first time he had ordered an ale from her two years ago. Not even all his knowledge of healing magic could cure him of this love sickness.\nMarin watched transfixed as Jocelyn wiped down the counter. A loose strand of golden hair fell over her eyes and she stopped to tuck it back. He marveled at how her skin glowed under the dim lamplight.\nMarin gulped down the rest of his drink, hoping to dampen the rising heat in his chest. \nAs soon as he placed his empty tin mug on the counter, Jocelyn glanced his way and strolled over. He appreciated her attentiveness. \n\\\"Another ale, Marin?\\\" Her bored voice floated above him, ethereal and smokey, eyes focusing on the entranceway. Marin heard heavy footsteps behind him. \nHe shifted on his stool. Jocelyn's hand was mere inches away, resting on the dark-grained wood table. It would be so easy to reach for his mug and accidentally brush his fingers against hers. But he was frozen, as still as a rabbit caught under a hunter's glare. He gazed up at her perfect face: lips pink as a spring peony, eyes sparkling like river pebbles on a sunny day. As much as he would have loved to remain under her spell all afternoon, he had to leave momentarily to see a patient. Jocelyn was his heart, but healing was his life's purpose. He looked into her eyes and smiled. \\\"Sure, just one more. Thank you.\\\"\nShe picked up his mug with a curt nod and stepped around him. He wondered what was wrong; normally she was warmer, gracing him with smiles of, \\\"My pleasure, Marin.\\\" His head swiveled to watch her walk away. The sway of her hips sent a new rush of heat through his entire body. \nAlbert, the blacksmith's oldest son, was leaning against the back wall. His tunic draped over his wide frame, and a streak of dark grease painted his forehead. \\\"Hey Jocey,\\\" he greeted her with his rumbling baritone.\nWith the fabric of her skirts brushing up against his trousers, she casually touched his muscled forearm and leaned up to kiss his cheek. \\\"Hi Al,\\\" she purred. \\\"We need to talk.\\\"\nMarin turned away. He heard stools scrape against the wooden floorboards as the lovers sat down, their voices hushed.\nHe was grateful for Albert. It made his feelings safer. It kept him from temptation. Jocelyn would never choose a mouse like Marin over a lion like Albert.\nSo, he wasn't jealous. He just had no interest in watching.\nThe mug had left a wet ring on the table when Jocelyn cleared it, and Marin traced its outline as he waited for his next round. If she was taking to Albert, he might have to wait awhile. That was, unless her father, Greggory, the tavern's owner, walked in through the back and sent the young man skittering away.\nAfter a few minutes, Marin's curiosity got the better of him. He didn't dare turn his head around, but he tilted his ear and strained to listen to the secret conversation. Albert's low voice growled in clipped phrases and Jocelyn's murmurs took on a pleading tone, but even in the quiet of the empty tavern, Marin couldn't decipher any of the words.\n \nHe was so engrossed in his attempt to eavesdrop that he startled when a hand clamped down on his shoulder. \n\\\"I thought I'd find you here,\\\" said a familiar voice.\n\\\"Good heavens, you scared me half to death sneaking up on me like that, Tilly!\\\"\n\\\"Don't be so dramatic, Marin,\\\" the dark-haired young woman chided. \\\"You've taken long enough of a meal. You're the last patron here.\\\" She gestured at the empty tables to emphasize her point. \\\"Come on. We are due at Jamison's cottage. His poor wife can barely get out of bed.\\\" \n\\\"You're right,\\\" he admitted with a twinge of guilt, and stood, pulling his satchel over his shoulder.\nMarin glanced over to where Jocelyn and Albert still sat, red-faced and hunched. He felt odd leaving without saying a farewell, especially because he had asked for another ale. But whatever the two were talking about seemed serious, and Marin decided it wouldn't be right to interrupt. So he turned toward the door, feeling a pang of annoyance. \nWhat had Albert done to upset Jocelyn? Didn't he realize how lucky he was to hold the affection of such a beautiful woman? \nReluctantly, Marin followed Tilly out the door and down the cobblestone street. \n\\\"I don't understand why you like that place so much. The food is so terrible that the smell is worse inside than out here in the filth,\\\" she remarked, nodding towards the piles of horse dung that baked in the midday heat. \n\\\"The location is convenient,\\\" he lied. There were taverns throughout the town. If it was really about convenience, he would eat wherever was closest. Maybe his secret lust for Jocelyn was more apparent than he hoped.\n\\\"Sure, Marin, that makes sense,\\\" she said, casually elbowing him in the ribs with a laugh. \nHe could feel his ears redden under the heat of the sun, and he adjusted the strap of his satchel.\n\\\"By the way, did you hear what the love birds were arguing about?\\\" Tilly asked.\n\\\"No, but\u2013\\\" he started, and then caught himself and tried to change the subject, \\\"I was too lost in thought, thinking about poor Alice and what herbs would best benefit her condition.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, not to worry, Marin. I brought fresh musk mallow and slippery elm so we can make a poultice to sooth her legs. Plus, I have an assortment of dry herbs that will help with her inflammation and joint aches,\\\" she said, patting her bag. Then she lowered her voice and cupped a hand beside her mouth so only Marin could hear her, and not the passing townspeople, \\\"I only ask because a few days ago Jocelyn told me she had a tightness in her lungs and asked if I would bring her some pennyroyal tea to ease the congestion. I didn't think much of it until she made me promise not to tell her father. So, you know what that might mean.\\\"\nMarin almost tripped on a cobblestone at hearing this news. Could it be? Could Jocelyn be with child? He pushed the thought away. Pennyroyal tea could be used for lots of ailments. And who would be so bold as to ask a nutrix to help end a pregnancy? \\\"That's a serious accusation, and\u2013and I don't think it's in Jocelyn's character to find herself in that way,\\\" Marin retorted, feeling defensive.\nTilly was younger than him by a few years, still a novice, but was a gifted healer. Most of the female nutrixes worked in the convent's hospital, but Tilly was one of the few who accompanied medics on house calls. So, if a woman in town needed some clandestine medical advice, it would make sense to seek Tilly for that help. But, Marin still had a hard time believing it. Desperately didn't want it to be true.\nTilly was quiet for a moment, considering. \\\"Yes, many people use pennyroyal tea to help clear up colds. It can be powerfully affective. Maybe she just didn't want to give her father the wrong impression.\\\"\n\\\"Yes, that must be it.\\\" Marin nodded emphatically, relieved that Tilly was able to come up with a plausible explanation. \\\"Greggory has never been a fan of her hanging around with Albert, so he might easily jump to the wrong conclusion.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

The boxes she was carrying went flying in every direction. \n\\\"Hello? A little help, maybe? And an apology?\\\" She huffed out the words as she began to gather her boxes.\nThe person who'd run into her was heading down the steps, apparently ready to carry on with his day. He was tall and substantial, with very long legs.\nNo wonder she'd gone flying.\nNow he turned from the bottom step to look up at her.\n\\\"Excuse me? You want me to apologize to you because you ran into me?\\\" His voice was deep and strong, matching his dark hair and eyes.\nCressida looked back at him, offended. \\\"I was carrying three boxes, obviously I couldn't see you.\\\"\n \\\"Well, maybe if you didn't walk around with your forward vision obscured you wouldn't run into people!\\\" The hulking stranger turned, preparing again to go on his way.\n\\\"You know, you're the rudest person I've met in a long time, and considering we live in New York City, that's really saying something,\\\" Cressida remarked as she finished putting her things back in the boxes. Now that she'd dropped them, there was no way she could pick up all three again, she'd have to leave one there, unattended, while she climbed the three flights to her new apartment.\nFuck.\n\\\"Welcome to the Big Apple,\\\" Hulking Stranger tossed over his shoulder as he began walking down the sidewalk.\nCressida pushed the box with books in it against the wall and began climbing the stairs with two boxes balanced in her arms. He was right about one thing, she could at least now see where she was going.\nShe climbed the stairs and opened the door to her new apartment. \nIt was a studio, with no real kitchen to speak of, and a tiny bathroom with the smallest shower Cressida had ever seen, but it was all hers, no roommates to deal with. The neighborhood, too, was kind of dodgy, but it suited her just fine.\nHopefully her other neighbors were nicer than Hulking Stranger.\nCressida sighed as she put her boxes down and went to look out the window. She had a great view of the fire escape and the street. Across the street was another group of apartment buildings, in typical NYC red brick. The summer sun was already heating the pavement and everything else, letting Cressida know that it was going to be another scorching August day. She'd debated buying a small AC unit for the window, but her money just wouldn't stretch that far, and she'd settled for a fan instead. In addition, the only good place for the AC would've been the back window, and that would've obscured her view of the tiny green space at the back of the building. It was a small oasis of plants and flowers, obviously lovingly tended by someone. Cressida didn't see Hulking Stranger doing the weeding and trimming necessary, so it must be the neighbor who lived between them on the second floor. She was looking forward to spending time out there at the small table, communing with nature as it were. The woman who'd shown her the apartment had assured her that it was a common space, free for everyone to use.\nShe quickly went back for the box she'd left in the entry and miraculously it was still there. She carried it up and sat on it for a moment, resting before going back to the car she'd borrowed to move herself in. She looked around at her new digs, satisfied for the moment. Even with the exorbitant cost of living in Manhattan, she knew she could just barely make it through her senior year living in this tiny space on the Lower East Side.\n\nLife was good.\nJust then the moving company showed up with her furniture, and the next couple hours were spent in getting it upstairs and put together. Cressida made a mental note to send her father a thank you text for springing for the movers. \nOn one of her trips down the stairs, she met an old woman on the second floor landing.\n\\\"Hello, I'm Mikey, I live in 2A,\\\" she said, smiling a welcome.\n\\\"Cressida Parker, 3A, obviously,\\\" Cressida answered, holding out a hand. \n\\\"Pleasure to meet you,\\\" Mikey responded, taking Cressida's hand in her wrinkled one. \\\"It will be nice to have a young person upstairs. Before we had Mr. Turnblatt, cranky and never separated his trash. You don't do anything like that, do you?\\\"\nCressida assured her that she was very quiet. \\\"I mostly just study.\\\"\n\\\"Wonderful. And have you met Mr. Stevens? Ground floor?\\\"\n That must be Hulking Stranger's name.\n\\\"Yeah, we ran into each other earlier,\\\" Cressida answered.\n\\\"Graham, his first name is. Not a very talkative young man, though his music is loud,\\\" Mikey informed her.\n\\\"Music? He plays loud music? Loud enough for you to hear?\\\" This could be a problem.\n\\\"Oh, yes, the whole neighborhood can hear it,\\\" Mikey said, nodding.\n \\\"Well, I need it pretty quiet, so hopefully it won't be too bad up where I am,\\\" Cressida countered. \\\"And it really is okay for me to spend time in the pretty garden out back? You must be the one who tends it?\\\"\n\\\"Oh, of course, of course,\\\" Mikey assured her. \\\"I'm usually out there in the mornings before it gets too hot, I just love working the soil. Please enjoy it.\n\\\"I don't want to keep you from your moving, though you seem to be doing this all alone? No friends to help you?\\\"\n\\\"Nope, everyone's still out of town for the summer, I'm all on my own,\\\" Cressida responded cheerfully. \\\"I'm a senior at NYU, and most of my friends are students as well. Don't worry, though,\\\" she added. \\\"I don't throw parties and stuff. Like I said, I'm pretty quiet, a journalism major, so I spend most of my time just reading and writing.\\\"\n\\\"I'm not concerned,\\\" Mikey told her with a smile. \\\"You just be careful, living all alone, a pretty little thing like you.\\\"\n\\\"I'm good,\\\" Cressida told her. \\\"I'd better get back to moving, I have to return my friend's friend's car this evening, and I still have a bunch of boxes left.\\\"\n\\\"I'll let you get back to it, then,\\\" Mikey said, turning to enter her apartment. \\\"Welcome to the building.\\\"\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" Cressida responded as she headed down the stairs.\nShe was right, the heat and humidity hit her as soon as she opened the door to the outside. She quickly walked the couple blocks to where she'd parked the car, enjoying knowing that this was going to be her neighborhood, that eventually these streets, the bodega on the corner, would become as familiar to her as the back of her hand. \nShe grabbed more boxes, carefully relocked the car, and walked back the way she'd come. This time she took only two, though she'd end up having to make an extra trip.\nWhen she got to the steps, Hulking Stranger was there as well, apparently having returned from wherever he'd had to go. He was carrying a sheaf of papers.\nHe saw her and opened the door, ostentatiously holding it so she could enter first.\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" Cressida muttered as she passed through.\n\\\"You're very welcome,\\\" he said in his deep voice, as he, too, entered.\nShe set the boxes down on the bottom stair so she could relax her aching wrists.\n\\\"I see you took my suggestion about only carrying two at a time,\\\" he remarked as he opened his front door. \\\"Much safer that way, I think.\\\"\n\\\"Listen, I heard you play your music pretty loud, Graham, is it?\\\" Cressida began without preamble. \\\"I'd appreciate it if you could sort of keep a lid on it, especially at night. I'm a student, and I have to study a lot, you know?\\\"\n\\\"Really?\\\" Graham leaned against the wall next to his door. \\\"Mikey tell you that?\\\" He folded well-toned arms as he considered her, and Cressida wondered just how bad she looked.\nShe nodded, wiping the sweat from her forehead with her sleeve.\n\\\"That's surprising, Mikey likes my music,\\\" Graham went on, looking at Cressida unsmilingly. He blinked at her, his eyes so brown they almost looked black. He swallowed, Adam's apple working above the collar of his black T-shirt.\n\n\n\n"}

Crushing the now empty cup in my hand, I searched for more. I wanted to drink my life away; I wanted to feel numb.\nMy stomach was churning, but I resisted the urge to puke. If my parents ever saw me like this, they would be very disappointed.\u00a0I could imagine the disappointment shining through their tears, turning Mom's eyes glassy. I shook the image out of my mind, not letting my guilt consume me.\nThe music was too loud, making my ears ring as bodies moved under the dim lights.. Like the loser I was, I was sitting alone, drinking my grief away. Nobody cared.\nI don't remember how I reached here, but one thing that I still remember was that I was tired of crying. Crying because of what I had turned to; crying for my unrequited love.\nAs if losing your best friends wasn't hard enough, life decided to add heartbreak to the mix.\nSomehow over the span of the past few months, I had lost myself completely. Losing the people that mattered along the way, leaving me utterly lonely. Truthfully, it was pathetic.\nNow, losing the girl I fell in love with was my last straw, pushing me into a downwards spiral.\nI was awakened out of my thoughts as I felt a hand crawl up my arm. A girl leaned near my ear, brushing her body against me. \\\"You look lonely, Elias. Want me to keep you company?\\\"\nI turned and stared at her for a second. I waited for a voice to nag my mind to remind me that what I was doing was wrong. But it was silent, deadly silent. Grabbing the back of her neck, I brought her lips to mine.\nMy lips moved along with the girl's in what was assumed to be a passionate way. Personally, it felt like a slobbery saliva exchange, not a kiss. My mind went back to the kiss (es) I shared with her. They were the true definition of passion.\nI pulled away from the unknown girl's face as thoughts of her invaded me again. Even with the buzz of alcohol, I could still remember her lips. Small pink lips that got enveloped in mine completely.\nThe girl in front of me was a gorgeous goddess. But when I looked closer, even with the dizzy head, I could see a flaw. The flaw that she was not her. She was not the girl I loved.\nYou love her, but she doesn't love you. Otherwise, she would not go around fucking another guy right after you confess your love for her, my mind graciously reminded me.\nI groaned and pulled the stranger close to me again. I connected my lips with hers, to which she eagerly responded. Her hand tugged at my jacket as her fingers curled around my locks and pulled. The kiss was good but not mind-melting. I could still feel the thump of music and hollering of the crowd.\nI'll fuck this girl, erase her from my mind. If our night was just sex for her, then I'll do the same. Just sex! That's what bad-boys do, right? Just like she taught. My drunk self decided.\nMy hands just slipped under the girl's shirt, touching the firmness of her belly, when I was pulled back by my shoulder.\nMy breath left me as I took her in. The girl with red-rimmed eyes, still a gorgeous shade of cocoa, gazed up at me with fury. The dark tumble of her hair was a mess, scattered everywhere. Her small lips quivered with anger, and her eyes showed hurt and sa\u00dfdness.\nI felt an invisible knife slice through me, making my body shake. My knees turned weak with pain, and my head pounded. I was feeling the pain that flashed through her eyes.\nHer eyes strayed away from mine to the girl behind me. They met mine once again and the betrayal in them was my last straw.\nSudden fury overtook me as my broken gaze turned to thundering glare. My fists clenched on my side, and anger thrummed through my veins. I pinned my eyes over her small form as my harsh eyes took in the girl who trained me to be a jackass. \n\nChapter 2\n\n2 Months Earlier:\nI pushed past the familiar doors, painted to a brighter shade of cherry red over the summer break. My feet scraped tiredly across the floor as the chatter suffocated me whole. Voices laced with both excitement and dread filled the school hallway.\nSome were excited, trying to share their summer experiences as fast as they could. Others cursed the very existence of the school and education system, wishing that summer break never came to an end.\nSeeing such a variety of expressions and voices filling the cramped space hallway was both over-stimulating and annoying.\nWithout my notice, a gigantic hand came on my shoulder and patted too hard, almost making me kiss the already dirty floor. I huffed as I regained my breath and balance and turned to glare at the atrocity I called my best friend.\nConnor Chandler just chuckled in response, with his shaggy strawberry blonde hair fluttering around him (in the non-existent wind), and icy blue eyes twinkling with humor.\n\\\"Well, it looks like you lost your muscles over the break, Elias,\\\" he mocked with fake concern, amusement dancing through his eyes.\nI rolled my eyes at his statement and shrugged his hand away from my shoulder. \\\"Seems like you lost your non-existent brain, want my help finding it? Oh, wait you never had one to begin with.\\\" My words amused him to no end, making hearty laughter slip past his lips. I huffed in response and rushed towards my locker.\nMy eyes scanned the surroundings and noticed the female population of school admiring the evident changes in Connor's appearance. It was impossible not to, with the tautness of his muscles and the golden tan of his skin he had gained over the summer. He was already an above average looking guy but with the magic of this summer, he was now in the 'HOT' male category.\nNow you wish you had agreed with him and joined sports camp too, instead of spending days filling yourself up with bookish knowledge and ice-cream? Maybe then you would have been successful in gaining her attention. The snarky voice of consciousness called out. Teenage self-depreciation habits right there.\nI shook my head at my thoughts and looked up from my dirty blue converse.\nLeaning against my locker was none other than Navya Kapur, the only girl to grab Connor's attention and his longtime girlfriend. Her long dark hair was collected in a complicated braid as she was leaning over her phone, oblivious to her surroundings.\nWith a mischievous smile on his face, Connor slipped his arms around her waist. She gasped in surprise, with her brown eyes turning wide. A choked scream slipped past her lips, getting lost in the havoc of voices in the hallway. Connor laughed as he twirled her around in his arms.\nAll the while, some female eyes turned away in disappointment. A few persistent girls still followed his movements. A group sighed in envy, making me shiver.\n\nFemale envy is dangerous.\nI pushed the thoughts of my ex out just as I saw Navya smacking him across his chest with a scowl. \\\"Don't you dare do that again,\\\" she hissed, narrowing her eyes. \\\"I will break your nose next time.\\\"\nIt was a threat she had actually followed through once.\nConnor leaned down and pecked her lips, grinning at her reaction. \\\"Baby, you don't want to ruin my pretty face. You love it too much.\\\" Connor pouted at the end for good measure.\nNavya just rolled her eyes in return, and soon her eyes landed on me. \\\"Hey there, Elias. How was your summer?\\\" \nI smiled and was just about to respond when Connor jumped in. \n\\\"You are blatantly ignoring your hot boyfriend, who got hotter over summer. Ignoring hotness is not right.\\\" He nodded at the end, agreeing with his statement.\nNavya just scoffed and stared at me expectantly, waiting for my answer. I couldn't help but chuckle as his eyes narrowed over her form. Did I forget to mention that he was too greedy for her attention?\nHe swiftly turned her around in his arms and connected their lips. I mentally cringed but kept a neutral face on the outside. PDA is disgusting. I know you are enjoying yourself, but please don't make others uncomfortable.\nMy head turned as I heard the patter of clicking heels coming our way, just as voices hushed over. My breath got caught in my throat as I stared at her, approaching closer.\nAndrea was the epitome of perfection in my life. She was just gorgeous, from her dark mocha skin to her dark eyes, she was the center of my attention as always.\n\n\n\n"}

They were dark, all consuming, like stepping into the orbs would mean an eternity of imprisonment. The eyes were forceful, they wanted me \u2013 I was an insect to a flame, too overcome to realize the fate awaiting me if I gave in. \nI blinked - and blinked again - remembering to concentrate and count. It would be over with soon, and I could leave it all behind. The eyes were then swallowed in their own darkness.\nMy life's sole purpose was to count down the weeks, days, and minutes until it was over. Twenty-one weeks, one hundred and forty-seven days, three thousand five hundred and twenty-eight minutes was all I had left to endure. \nHow strange it was to be nothing but a shell housing a ticking clock.\nEven stranger was though my life continued afterwards, I couldn't see beyond the end date. It was blurred and faded, as though another person would take over while I fell to the sidelines. But I didn't focus on this; my sights were set on the singular date. Nothing subsequently mattered. \nTwenty-one weeks and I'd be free. \nCampus was actively buzzing. The outside air was so cold and brittle, it threatened to shatter anyone standing outdoors long enough. As I glided down the main building hallway, I took note of the many faces I recognized but didn't know a fragment about. I wondered if they saw me, the girl I used to be. Or maybe I appeared as completely hollow as I felt, a ghost haunting Columbia Gorge Community College.\nTucking the stick-straight strands of chestnut hair behind both ears and smoothing my rumpled sweater, I trudged farther until I saw the group of people I knew only recognized me as the older, but better, model of myself. \n\\\"Elliot! Come over here!\\\" \nSucking in a breath as though I hadn't in months, I ventured towards the group and slid into place.\n \\\"Hi, Tyson,\\\" I said, meeting the gaze of the person who had called my name. It was evident the others had been in the middle of discussing something I would rather avoid but was now forced into by association: the party last weekend. \nI hadn't attended, nor had I had any desire to. The party was held in the same house at the same time nearly every weekend. Having gone once was enough, as every time following was the exact same experience. \n\\\"You missed out, Elliot. It was crazy!\\\" Hudson, who was standing to Tyson's left, exclaimed, accentuating his already excitable features. \nCambrie, the raven-haired girl next to me, nudged my shoulder softly. \\\"'Crazy' is a bit of an exaggeration, don't you think?\\\" She smiled slyly.\n\\\"An exaggeration?\\\" Hudson repeated, mouth hinged open. \\\"Serious shit when down!\\\"\n Cambrie rolled her deep, coffee eyes. \\\"Right. I forgot. A fight breaking out at a party is 'serious shit.'\\\"\n \\\"It is if it's over the girl who told you she'd go out with you the following weekend, but was hanging onto somebody else all night,\\\" Hudson proclaimed.\n The sly smile returned to Cambrie. \\\"You know, the real tragedy is you thinking Lilah Evans wasn't dating four other guys simultaneously when she told you that. She has a bit of proven track record.\\\"\n Hudson winced, but continued. \\\"But that guy? Drake, or whatever his name is. I mean, she could be with me!\\\"\n Cambrie's next words solidified why she was my best friend, until death do us part. \\\"Anybody could be with you, Hudson.\\\"\n\nAt this, Tyson laughed so his bulky frame shuddered. Reflexively, I took a small step backward.\n\\\"You know,\\\" Cambrie started, \\\"the more I think about it, you two might be perfect for each other.\\\"\n \\\"Shut up,\\\" Hudson muttered, while Tyson still shook with amusement. The conversation was abruptly put on a hold, however, as something in the hallway garnered Tyson's attention. More specifically, someone.\n As soon as my eyes settled on who had snagged Tyson's, I needed no further indication about what was to shortly commence. The person Tyson, and now the other two around me, were staring at was walking, or rather awkwardly ambling, up the hallway with stiff legs and jerking arms. It was a sight I had witnessed on multiple occasions, as was the one due to happen any moment now.\n \\\"Hey, Ben!\\\" Tyson blurted, halting Ben's feet. His body still exuded short, rigid movements as he stood just beyond our group. His face was impartial, and even though his honey colored eyes had registered what was about to happen, he wore no suggestion of fear. \\\"You might want to start wearing a beeper, you know, so that people know you're coming up behind them. Your spastic body is kind of a hazard. Might knock someone over.\\\"\n Ben let his gaze linger on Tyson for a second longer than was comfortable, and then, as if nothing happened, continued walking forward in the same manner as Tyson had commented. It wasn't as though he could help it: Ben had cerebral palsy, and based off everything I had been told, the movements he made were a result of the condition. His voice, too, was also unsteady, and I was happy he hadn't used it, because Tyson would be sure to wreak havoc given the opportunity.\n A few mumblings brought my attention back to the group. Tyson looked rather proud of himself while Hudson sported a ludicrous grin. Cambrie, on the other hand, was squinting at them both through slanted, narrowed eyes, her mouth a straight line.\n \\\"Can you imagine if we had gone to high school with him?\\\" Tyson said. \\\"Just think of him in PE.\\\"\n A booming laugh erupted from Hudson. \\\"It would have been shit show. Oh, dude \u2013 think about dodgeball!\\\"\n Tyson roared heartily before settling his gaze on me. \\\"Pretty funny, huh, Ell?\\\"\n I hated when he called me Ell.\n \\\"Mmmm,\\\" I mumbled, not making eye contact and searching for an opportunity to remove myself.\n \\\"You know,\\\" Cambrie said, drawing in a breath, \\\"I would have liked to have seen him in high school.\\\" My eyes snapped curiously to hers. \\\"I hear he's pretty smart. It would have been a great sight to see him outsmart your ass in class.\\\"\nTyson winced and pretended to mend the mental wounds.\nTen minutes later, I was free from the group and in my first class. And as I sat in silence, I couldn't help but count down the hours until the day was over, the imaginary hands of a clock moving slowly inside me.\n***\n \\\"Is that you, Ell?\\\" my father asked as I quietly shut the front door.\n \\\"No, I'm a robber here to steal your horrible vinyl collection and outdated TV,\\\" I said and slung my book bag on the ground next to the loveseat. The lack of laughter gave me some surprise, so I cautiously trekked into the kitchen to find my father pouring two glasses of iced tea. After giving up alcohol completely, the man thrived on his iced tea, the middle of January or not.\n\\\"How was your day?\\\" \n \\\"Fine,\\\" I said, and took the glass, bringing the cool liquid to my lips. \\\"Thanks.\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

She is getting ready for the start of the season.\n\n#track, #school #friendship #highschool \n\nTrack Team\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nStudents were gathered around the track field the following afternoon. I recognised most of them from both last year on the CGC track team, but some were new, most likely to be entering freshman. Having spotted a copper-haired girl who looked as though she wished to be anywhere else, I sauntered over.\n \\\"You look even less enthusiastic than last year,\\\" I said, amid the chattering collection of people donned in athletic clothing.\n Julia shot me a fractious look, folded her arms over her chest, and said, \\\"I really hate track.\\\"\n \\\"Then why even tryout?\\\" I asked.\n \\\"C'mon, Sophie. You know why. My parents are certifiably psychotic, and they think that\\\" \u2013 Julia threw both hands in the air and formed air quotes \u2013 \\\"if I didn't have some outlet, I'd become a reckless substance abuser and fritter my life away.\\\" She then stole a quick glance in my direction. \\\"And they're probably right.\\\"\n I raised an eyebrow. Julia and I had been introduced at the start of track season last year. We bonded immediately as she appeared to be the only other member who established a similar love/hate relationship with track like I did.\nOnce last year, I had given her a ride home and was invited to stay for dinner by her parents. The dinner, while delicious, quickly turned sour as her parents began an interrogation on the events of her day.It became clear they did not trust her, and I wondered what had happened in her past to warrant their behavior. My memory of the dinner was that it unfolded much like an episode of an investigative drama.\u00a0\n I wasn't one to pry into someone's personal life, but as time went on, I did become curious about Julia's past. It took some time, but with tidbits of information lent here and there, I was able to learn she had had a stint in rehab a couple years ago to address a drinking problem. Regardless of everything, Julia has been a constant for me during track season.\nThe track team had two coaches: Coach Rodriguez and Coach Nelson. Rodriguez was the good cop; he was the friendliest of the two and was chatting merrily to a group huddled around him. Nelson, the bad cop, was much stricter; he was standing on the field sideline, watching its entirety as if inspecting this year's prospects. I nearly laughed at the thought, because I knew as well as Nelson the track team was lacking in numbers, and whatever talent showed up would be placed on the team.\nBoth coaches let me race my event, the five-thousand meter, with little fuss. I had been participating in long distance races since high school and, while I still raced at a decent speed, my times were a far cry from what they had been in high school. But I wasn't losing sleep over this. Not on the nights I was able to sleep, anyway. \n \\\"Alright, alright, everyone.\\\" Coach Rodriguez's clear voice instantly quieted the idle prattle. \\\"Welcome to another year of Columbia Gorge Track!\\\" A few hands clapped in applause, but his enthusiasm was ultimately left unmatched. \\\"For those of you who are returning this year, thank you. For those of you who are new, thank you. It's not a big secret our track team has been \u2013 uh \u2013 slightly understaffed, if you will, and looking around it's fair to say we will need each and every one of you. So, show up tomorrow too, please.\\\"\n A hushed laugh circulated the field. Now, even those with doubts about making the team could be rest assured.\n\\\"That doesn't mean you can skid by during tryouts,\\\" the huskier voice of Rodriguez's counterpart said. \\\"Just because the team is small doesn't give you permission to not take it seriously. We'll be watching and judging accordingly. I expect nothing less than a hundred percent effort from every single one of you.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

The dastardly man wanted to conquer the world. She was twenty already, not very pretty and unwed. She never as much as uttered a cross word about him, but he just had to thin the ranks of eligible men with his miserable wars.\n\\\"Truly, is marriage the only aspiration for a woman?\\\" she exclaimed, opening her arms to greet Miss Carter, a confirmed spinster. \\\"Your example testifies marvelously to the opposite. The enjoyment of life is writ in your smallest feature!\\\"\n\\\"Good morning to you, my dearest girl. Aren't you a sight for sore eyes!\\\" Miss Carter replied gladly, after exchanging the feather-light embrace. \\\"If I am so enamoured with life, it is only thanks to the hospitality of my friends.\\\"\nAnd the woman gave a sharp look to Mabel's mother, Mrs. Walton.\nNaturally, it didn't go unnoticed, and Mrs. Walton pursed her lips before reassuring Miss Carter in some haste that friendship is a precious gift, but any woman in her opinion would be happiest in a fulfilling marriage.\nMabel understood her mother's brief lapse of good manners perfectly: this was exactly the sort of capricious thought that the company of Miss Carter instilled in the young ladies. One rumour hinted that she could do even more damage to their morality, but those who said it remained tantalizingly vague about the details.\nIn short, in Mabel's reckoning, Mrs. Walton didn't hold Miss Carter in high esteem and only suffered to put up with her for a very good reason. This reason was an open secret to Mabel.\nMiss Carter's company, for all her shortfalls, had been the most sought after in the whole of Lancashire ever since Mr. Everett Chesterton moved into the Chesterton Manor just after Yuletide.\nThis gentleman intrigued everyone. He was, by all reports, of excellent breeding, a decorated war hero and on top of that tall and uncommonly handsome. Yet he had stubbornly if politely refused all the overtures of the local worthies so far.\nMiss Carter therefore had earned the distinction of being the only living soul that he had called upon regularly, owing to the distant family connexions.\nLike a dog in the manger, Mrs. Walton characterized this vexatious situation, because Miss Carter had passed the age divide after which marriage was no longer in the cards. She seemed content with her situation, yet took up time that Mr. Chesterton could have spent more productively. For example, making new acquaintances or even courting an eligible young lady, of whom Walton's household had two.\nMabel, however, loved the eccentric old maid with all the unsophisticated enthusiasm of her impulsive heart, though she saw her rarely. Alas, the inquiries about Miss Carter's own doings had to wait until her mother concluded the interview.\nAs Mabel's eyes drifted restlessly around the sitting room she knew intimately, they studiously avoided the watercolour by her own hand. It was a still life of flowers in a vase and tossed artfully around it. She had wished to have chosen the whimsical wildflowers over the waxy camellias as her subject, but alas. Her mother deemed it worthy of covering the spot left by the winter's damp in the corner, forever fixing her regret right in front of her eyes.\nAside from the other paintings, the piano afforded some diversion. Also on display were her sister, Hazel, and Miss Carter's companion, Amelia. Both ladies remained as silent as the furniture to this point, an unexpected lapse from Hazel. Despite that, the conversation hummed like the wheels in the textile factories, though spinning out a product of far lesser quality than the English wool.\n   \n\\\"Is Mr. Chesterton reclusive by nature then?\\\" Mrs. Walton inquired. \\\"Or is it a temporary state due to him adjusting to life in the countryside?\\\"\nAn air of doubt hung about her\u2014it was the city life that needed adjusting to, not the good and proper existence at nature's bosom.\n\\\"Oh, I assure you ennui is not characteristic of Mr. Chesterton! He is an amiable man of a perfectly choleric temperament,\\\" Miss Carter responded. \\\"In fact, his seclusion is a deliberate change of habits to satisfy his elder brother's wishes.\\\"\n\\\"It is not my place to judge, of course, but how cruel it is from Lord Chesterton to demand such sacrifices from his brother!\\\" Mrs. Walton exclaimed, aghast. \\\"Besides, he must know how we value good company in our parts, even though we lack the glamour of London.\\\"\nAn undeniable fondness reflected on Miss Carter's face. It was easy enough to see that she had preferred the elder brother, Lord Chesterton. It seemed unfair at this moment, particularly since he acted as a bit of a tyrant, hiding away the sensational\u2014and a bachelor!\u2014Everett from them.\n\\\"He believes it to be beneficial for his brother to settle the restlessness of his soul in solitude.\\\"\n\\\"How so?\\\" The question slipped from the tip of Mabel's tongue before she could restrain her curiosity. The conversations about Mr. Chesterton, his prospects and his fortune, had worn her patience throughout the winter, but now, a new, far more engaging light had been cast upon his character.\n\\\"The war, my dear, sharpened men's\u00a0 nature in the same manner a sculptor's chisel reveals angles in shapeless marble. Those who were of a steady character, it made steadier. Those prone to the excesses of passions grew further unsettled.\\\"\nIntrigued, Mabel watched Miss Carter with wide-flung eyes, as if her staring could summon more details. \\\"But didn't he resign his commission with the navy? He must have done it seeking quieter glories.\\\"\n\\\"It is so, but war doesn't just stop when it's over. It goes on inside us.\\\" Miss Carter afforded the snow-white lace of the curtains a far-away look.\nMabel swallowed, wondering what tragic story hid behind it. \n\\\"Why is it that we won the war, but still talk of nothing else?\\\" Mabel's sister Hazel unexpectedly complained, putting down her embroidery with a clunk.\nMrs. Walton's brows raised in consternation, but Miss Carter was already speaking.\n\\\"Because, my dear, it was the single most important thing in the lives of our generation.\\\"\nHazel lowered her eyes back to her embroidery, but Mabel caught a mocking flash between the curled eyelashes. At seventeen, Hazel ached only for the future and joy. The past and melancholy were not worth her time.\n\\\"My darlings, let's leave such heavy subjects to men,\\\" Mrs. Walton exclaimed, for once in agreement with her youngest daughter. \\\"So, you have it from Mr. Chesterton himself that he would soon be more affable, after he satisfies his brother's eccentric caveat?\\\"\nMiss Carter leaned forward with a teasing smile on her lips. Even her cheeks flushed in anticipation. \\\"Oh, yes, undeniably.\\\"\nSilence fell over the cozy room, interrupted only by the ticking of the clock and Hazel's needle punching through the canvas and subsequent rustle of the tightening thread.\n\\\"My darling Miss Carter! It seems to me that you know of something very interesting.\\\" Mrs. Walton was not above begging when her long nose caught a whiff of a choice morsel of news.\n\\\"Indeed, I do, Mrs. Walton.\\\"\nSilence, again, reigned over the five ladies, while Miss Carter smiled beatifically, though her eyes glittered with a concealed emotion. Mabel endeavored not to fidget in her chair. The pressure built up the same way it does in a kettle left without a supervision on the stove, just before it over-boils.\n\n\n\n"}

I dodged and ducked around passersby to keep from losing any bit of momentum. A crate, left out by a busy storekeeper, loomed in front of me, and I was forced to leap over it. My height of five feet and five inches made this an easy enough feat. Gasps filled the air in my wake as my boots landed solidly on the ground.\nThe sight of a fourteen-year-old young lady racing along the pavement was not a typical one, I would grant, let alone one who had an armful of sheet music clutched to her chest. Still, it wasn't as though I was causing any problems. Well, not a real problem. The real problem would be if I was late. Signori Bianchi would have me singing nothing but scales for a week.\nA stitch in my side made me regret the pastries I'd consumed during tea. If I'd had any idea I would be racing time itself, I might have been more moderate in what I ate.\nAnd why, oh why, had I allowed the maid to lace me up so tightly? \nThough not as tightly laced as some fashion dictated, my school uniform was not made for this kind of strenuous activity.\nI had spent too long trying to convince Constable Higgins to tell me what leads he had about the latest series of thefts in the area and now my legs were paying for it.\nMy boots skidded several inches when I came to a stop in front of my destination, Regaining my balance, I hurried up the stone steps and rang the doorbell. I braced myself against the door frame to get my breath back.\nThe church bells rang out as the door opened. \\\"Good day, Mrs. Williams,\\\" I said, straightening up. \\\"I hope you are well today.\\\"\nMrs. Williams raised an eyebrow and shook her head as she stepped aside. \\\"You're late, Miss Norton.\\\"\n\\\"No. I'm not,\\\" I said, unable to not sound as though I was out of breath. \\\"It is four o'clock exactly. You can hear the bells ringing now, I am sure.\\\" I paused, letting the distant church bells prove my point for me. \\\"This is the time for my appointment with Maestro Bianchi.\\\"\n\\\"Don't try to talk me into circles,\\\" the woman warned as I entered the house. \\\"I am well aware of your sweet talking ways, Miss Aida Norton, but it's not me you have to convince. It's Signori Bianchi himself. You know what he thinks about tardiness.\\\"\nAny hope I had of her putting in a good word for me died as she closed the door and then walked away. My heart thudded heavily in my chest as I moved to the parlor to await my music teacher. I sank onto the familiar green velvet settee, grateful for a moment to rest my feet after my run.\nI'd barely taken a breath when the pocket door connecting the parlor to the music room was shoved open. I lunged back onto my feet to curtsy. \\\"You are late,\\\" Signori Luca Bianchi said without a word of greeting. \\\"I've warned you once before.\\\"\nHow could he know that? He heard the doorbell and I hadn't said a word, so he couldn't know I was out of breath. Had he heard the door open? Mrs. Williams hadn't spoken to him in the other room; I would have at least heard her voice if she had. What gave me away?\n\\\"Good afternoon, Signori Bianchi,\\\" I said, resisting the urge to protest the accusation. \\\"Is four o'clock not our usual appointment?\\\"\nHis dark brown eyes peered at me, his forehead furrowed with disapproval. \\\"Do you expect your voice to be at its best when you are unable to breathe in the proper way?\\\"\n\\\"No, Maestro,\\\" I said reluctantly. \\\"I lost track of the time, but I was not late! I know how much you dislike tardiness.\\\"\n\\\"Come.\\\" He spun on his heel and strode back into the room where we had our lessons.\n\nSimon Anderson was already there. The fifteen-year-old flushed red as he rose from the piano. \\\"Miss Norton,\\\" he said with a formal bow. His dark hair fell forward onto his forehead. \\\"You're looking well today.\\\"\n\\\"Good afternoon, Mr. Anderson.\\\" In the last two years, he had been my main accompaniment during my lessons. \\\"Have you mastered the Liszt, yet?\\\"\n\\\"I'm still working on it.\\\" His eyes glowed with delight as his cheeks became rosy, much to my amusement. \\\"But I'm making progress!\\\"\n\\\"Let us begin,\\\" Signori Bianchi said sharply. \\\"We shall see, Signorina Norton, just what sort of damage you have done to yourself. We will begin with something easy. The scales.\\\"\nI think I managed to get through the scales without too much of a struggle. Signori Bianchi pursed his lips and said nothing. \\\"After the Ball,\\\" he snapped out, once I'd finished the exercise. \nHis intent may have been to tire me too quickly. After the Ball, though, was one of my favorite songs to sing. I could barely keep from bouncing as Mr. Anderson played the intro. Nothing filled me with more joy than singing, especially this song. I could barely keep from moving in time to the beat as I sang. As my voice trailed away from the final note, I sank into a deep curtsy as I had been taught to do when I was younger.\nAfter all, knowing how to accept adulation set one on the right path to learning a new skill. Or at least, that's what I had been told during my first lesson, when I hadn't sung a note. My mother had been insistent on that point, and I'd never forgotten it, though I'm sure my current instructor wished I had.\nA single pair of hands applauded me and I lifted my head in expectation. Signori Bianchi was as he was when I began the song: arms crossed and a disapproving expression on his face. At the moment, his disapproval was focused on the piano.Mr. Anderson blanched, lowered his hands, and made a show of searching his music.\n\\\"Signorina Norton, you continue to rush,\\\" Signori Bianchi said, returning his gaze to me. He clapped his hands in the beat of a waltz. \\\"Again, you do not follow the rhythm of the music. You rush ahead and have no control.\\\"\nWith a flinch, I lowered my gaze. He wasn't wrong. \\\"Yes, sir,\\\" I said, striving for a humble tone. Explaining that the music swept me away would do no good. I'd tried that once and earned myself a scolding in answer.\nAny musician or singer worth anything followed the time of the music they were performing. Emotion was all well and good, but only if you kept it firmly reined in. To lose control was a sin Signori Bianchi would not tolerate.\nAt the piano, Mr. Anderson shuffled music. In front of me, I heard Signori Bianchi heave a loud, long-suffering sigh. \\\"Perfection is not achieved in one day,\\\" the Italian man finally said. \\\"We will merely have to continue on.\\\"\nI'd never doubted that. Signori Bianchi was the most stubborn, prideful man I'd ever met. He would not give up, no matter how much I failed to meet his high standards. One way or another, he would mold me into a model student, or die in the attempt. Previous instructors had not been as stubborn as Signori Bianchi\n\\\"You must practice every day, Signorina,\\\" the maestro said, his tone firm. \\\"Do not think I am unaware of how you run around and do not give music the first place.\\\"\nI couldn't keep from frowning. Surely, he understood that I had other lessons at the school. \\\"I am not referring to Miss Hunter's lessons,\\\" Signori Bianchi continued, raising his eyebrow at me as though he had read my thoughts. \\\"Don't think I'm not aware of how often you chase after the local constable.\\\"\n\\\"It's true I speak to the man often, but I wouldn't say I chase him,\\\" I said with caution. I had no idea where he was going with the conversation. \\\"I am interested in the criminal cases he investigates. Who knew a small place like this could hold....\\\" My voice trailed away as the signori stared at me.\n\n\n\n"}

The air was thick with a concoction of a thousand smells, from clean crisp laundry to the sweet and savoury smells of the airport food court. \nThis 2 AM flight to New York had attracted a mixed crowd. Some serious looking businessmen impatiently checked their Rolexes whilst tired, unshowered backpackers desperately tried to not pass out on their rucksacks propped up on the grey waiting lounge seats. \nI loved flying. I don't know what it was about them but airports just gave me the greatest rush. Maybe it was the fact that airports didn't seem to adhere to the laws of time. Walking into one transported you into another dimension, where drinking at 10am or sleeping on the floor in an immaculate suit were perfectly normal and respectable things to be doing.

I guess passengers walking in already on loud telephone calls were a bad omen for them. \n\\\"And remember to call me as soon as you land, and after your first day too.\\\" \n\\\"Don't you worry, I'll let you know all the details of the raves, drugs and parties I'll take part in.\\\" \n\\\"Kopter Sittawat,\\\" she barked. \u00a0\\\"If I hear of you being in so much as the same room as a drug you'll be in big trouble, Mister! You'll have to bear the full force of your own mother's wrath if you use our family's fortune for such frivolous expenses.\\\" \nShe was always so easy to wind up, though I was beginning to suspect that she played into it for comedic effect.\u00a0\n\\\"You know I'm not like that Mom, I- Sorry sir, I think that's my seat?\\\" The elderly man in seat C3 grumbled as I squeezed past him into my place.\n\\\"You've gotta study hard while you're there, my love. Work hard, get good grades and try your best. That way you'll be able to attend a good university there too and be well equipped to take over the business.\\\" \nA dull gnawing feeling began in my stomach. Ah yes, the family business. Sounds so ominous, but really my family's claim to fortune was in Thai food.\u00a0\nMy great-grandmother had set the business up during the Vietnam war back in the nineteen fifties as a small food stand for American soldiers. As a very good-looking single mother aged twenty-seven, she gained moderate success amongst the homesick soldiers but the business really started booming when her eldest daughter, my grandmother, took over twenty years later. \nAged twenty-four my Grandmother married an American businessman. With his wealth and business know-how and her ruthless culinary expertise, they grew that small stall into a Thai food empire with branches all over Bangkok. \nSince then, it's been passed down the female line of my family from sister to sister and mother to daughter. My mother was the one to take the business international, hence why my uncle was stationed in New York as the US branch manager. Unfortunately, since my Grandmother's generation there's been a drought of female heirs. My mother was born the eldest of two with just one younger brother and seven male cousins. As the only child of my mother, I'll be the first man to have run the business in all sixty three years of its existence.\nNo Pressure. \n\\\"-and remember to wear clean underwear every day,\\\" she rambled on. \\\"I'll be checking!\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"I don't even wanna think about how you'd be able to check that Mom, but I will.\\\"\nThe familiar 'bing bong' of a cabin announcement filled the air.\n\\\"Ladies and gentleman,\\\" sounded a low, cool female voice. \\\"We will be taking off shortly, please be sure to stowaway all handheld luggage and switch off any mobile devices. Thank you.\\\"\n\\\"Mom, I'm gonna have to go, they're taking off. I'll call once I'm with Uncle Nok. Love you!\\\" \nThe flight attendant gives me a relieved look as I hang up the phone and proceeds with the safety demonstration. \nTake offs are always my least favourite part of the experience. At least with landing you had the giddy excitement of being in a new place and finally getting out of this stuffy metal can, with take offs all you have to look forward to are leg cramps. \nThe plane lurched forward and I held my breath, I'll be damned if I let my ears pop on this flight. I resisted the urge to close my eyes, looking out the window at the twinkling lights of Bangkok below growing smaller and fainter. My heart sank knowing that next time I'd see those lights again would be in December when we break up for the winter holidays. I'd never been so far from home for so long, if I didn't know my workaholic mother any better, I'd be scared she'd get lonely. \nI sat back in my seat and finally closed my eyes. What will have changed when I return this winter? Will I be a different person to the one I am now? \nWith one final lurch, the plane finally stabilised and the seatbelt light pinged back on.\nI pulled out my sleep mask and firmly blocked all the light I could from my vision in the hopes of at least a few hours of interrupted sleep.\nOnly nineteen hours to go.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAmerican passport control terrifies me. \nI guess it must be the combination of my brown skin, dark hair and dead eyes that always gets me pulled over for 'random' searches. You try looking anything but dead after a nineteen hour flight, it's harder than it looks. \nWhen I finally got to see the light of day, or night as it turned out to be, an hour and a half had already passed since the plane had landed. I looked down at my phone to see seventeen missed calls. No prizes for guessing who those were from. \nI walked over to the small crowd still milling around the baggage claim carousel. There were only three bags left, spinning round and round like a sad merry-go-round. I hoisted my black wheelie bag into the air, narrowly missing a disgruntled looking pilot, and began walking across the speckled grey plastic floor towards the exit.\u00a0\nOn the other side of a red velvet rope I could see my uncle as he anxiously searched for me on his tippy toes. I caught his eye and waved enthusiastically.\u00a0\n\\\"Nok!\\\" I yelled as I ran over to him, my bag clipping my heels. I could see the wave of relief rush over him as I pulled up beside him. \n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nThread of Gold: Camille Dufleur is young girl. She is a magic gold weaver. The Queen arrives to take Camille away from her mean family.\n\n#fairytale, #family, #medival, #weaving, #fantasy, #magic\n\nThread of Gold\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nCamille Dufleur was eight years old when she saw the carriage in the woods.\nIt wasn't an ordinary carriage; the golden wheels shimmered like summer wheat, and the black horses' hooves ate up the narrow path. And on the side of the carriage, Camille realized, was the royal seal: a tower with a morning star over it. The king, perhaps?\nBut none of this mattered.\nNot when her mother was so furious.\nCamille twisted. But Adele Dufleur was a blacksmith's wife, and her grip was hard as iron. Camille could feel Adele's calloused fingers digging into her skin where her dirty white cap sleeve ended.\n\\\"Hurry, Mimi,\\\" Adele said. \\\"It'll rain soon.\\\" She yanked her over a tree root. \\\"If it wasn't for you, we'd be there by now.\\\"\nCamille frowned. Considering that they were running late because she'd spent the morning cleaning white ash out of the fireplace, she wasn't entirely sure this was fair. \\\"But I'm tired, maman.\\\"\n\\\"Well, you shouldn't have stayed up reading.\\\"\nCamille dragged her feet. She could see the thatched roof of the cottage, peeking its head above the trees. She wished that she was at the forge, curled up in bed with a cup of tea and her book. Her father would be puttering around the kitchen, stomping his leather boots and smelling of metal and salt. Her mother rarely made her come to the cottage on Saturdays, but something had changed today.\nShe glanced nervously at the cottage. Camille knew what she would find there: dusty curtains, two hard wooden chairs and a spinning wheel. It had been the same routine for the last four years. Her mother would knit by the window, and Camille would sit at the wheel and do...\nSomething.\nIt was difficult to describe.\nThe feeling was instinctual. She let it pour out of her, gathering the golden substance in a glass phial. It always left her feeling strange after, as if she was floating.\nWeaving, Adele called it.\nCamille could remember the first time they'd gone to the cottage. Her mother had paused near a rose bush, pointing at a spider clinging to a glistening web.\n\\\"Do you see that spider?\\\" Adele had asked. \\\"It reaches inside of itself and finds a strand of silk; it weaves something out of nothing. You can do that too, Mimi. You can create golden threads that turn into dreams.\\\"\nHer mother had been kind at first. Camille received the best cuts of meat at dinner, and the day that she had filled a whole phial, her mother had bought her a pink dress with ribbons, frilly as a wedding cake.\nBut she was not kind now, Camille thought. Not since her father had his accident last month and lost his arm; the forge now rumbled on like a sleeping dragon, spitting coals and red sparks, but nobody was there to man it. Furniture disappeared from their home. The rickety wooden rocking chair went first, and then a cozy armchair by the fire. Their best silverware. Her mother's wedding ring.\n\nNow, her mother forced her to weave with threats of slaps and no dinner. Bruises braceleted her arms, purple as plums.\nThe cottage drew closer. Fear shot through her, and Camille stopped, yanking her arm out of her mother's grip. \\\"I won't go!\\\" \n\\\"Mimi\u2014\\\"\n\\\"No!\\\" She set her chin. \\\"You can't make me.\\\"\nShe would be brave, Camille decided, like Rissolyta in her book; the warrior queen let nothing frighten her. Unfortunately, Rissolyta did not have Adele Dufleur as a mother, and Camille shrank back as Adele's eyes darkened.\n\\\"Camille,\\\" she snapped, \\\"you will come with me, or you will go without supper tonight. Do you understand?\\\"\n\\\"Is there a problem here?\\\"\nHer mother jerked back. The beautiful carriage had stopped next to them, and a woman wearing a golden circlet peered at them through the window. Camille sucked in a breath. The queen.\nQueen Brigid Delafort was smaller than people described, and even more beautiful. Brilliant red hair tumbled over her shoulders, and her dark eyes burned like coals. \n\\\"Your Majesty.\\\" Her mother had gone pale. \\\"What an honour.\\\" She gave what Camille assumed was a curtsey but looked more like an involuntary jerking motion. \\\"Please, don't let us keep you. My daughter is tired and being difficult. That's all.\\\"\nQueen Brigid pursed her lips. Then she swung open the door of the carriage. Camille thought she heard one guard inside groan and mutter something about this being typical, but the queen ignored him.\n\\\"What's your name, child?\\\"\n\\\"Camille,\\\" she whispered.\nThe queen placed two fingers under her chin. \\\"You're a pretty little thing, aren't you?\\\"\nCamille flushed. She was painfully aware of the dirt caked in her blonde hair, and the rips on her sleeves. Even her brown eyes \u2014 more of a hazel, and not nearly as beautiful as the queen's obsidian gaze \u2014 felt plain.\nHer palms grew sweaty. Fortunately, Camille was spared a response by the queen's sharp intake of breath.\n\\\"You're a Dayweaver.\\\" There was no accusation in Brigid's voice; only curiosity. \\\"And a powerful one. I can see it on you, child.\\\" She dropped Camille's chin, turning to Adele. \\\"You know the laws. The girl is too young to train; she must wait until she's seventeen.\\\"\nHer mother paused. \\\"I wasn't\u2014\\\"\n\\\"You were.\\\" Brigid's voice was cool. \\\"As you know, I'm a Dayweaver myself. I can sense the magic that runs in her veins. She's been using it.\\\"\n\\\"I had no choice.\\\" Adele reminded her of the rabbits that they used to catch in traps, right before they skinned them for dinner. \\\"My husband has lost his job, you see. We rely on Mimi's weaving to pay the bills. I sell her phials of somnium at the market.\\\" Beads of sweat clung to her forehead. \\\"Please, Your Majesty; do not punish us for this.\\\"\nBrigid pursed her lips. The queen had the same look in her eyes that the fishmonger at the market got, Camille thought, when he was deciding how much a cut of salmon was worth. Weighing and deliberating.\n\\\"I will make you a deal,\\\" Brigid said finally. \\\"I will pay you for the somnium that Camille would produce each week in perpetuity. In exchange, you must let her come to the palace with me. I will bring her up as my ward.\\\"\n\\\"Your ward?\\\" Adele looked incredulous. \\\"But look at her! She's\u2014\\\"\nHer mother cut off. Camille could hear her unspoken words, hanging between all of them like the silvery morning mist over a lake. But she's poor. But she's ugly. But she's difficult. Her cheeks, if possible, became even hotter.\n\nBrigid ignored her mother, bending down so that their eyes were level. \\\"What do you say, Camille?\\\" Her dark eyes were bright. \\\"Would you like to come back to the castle with me?\\\"\nCamille hesitated.\nShe thought of her father, swinging her up on his shoulders, laughing as she stretched to pluck a green apple off a tree. The smell of the forge, all smoke and salt. She would miss him, Camille realized, and the little frog in the back garden, the spotted one that hopped on her windowsill each morning.\nBut the idea of not going to the cottage with her mother today \u2014 not going ever again \u2014 was too tantalizing to resist.\n\\\"Yes,\\\" Camille said. \\\"I would like that very much.\\\"\nFrom there, things moved quickly. The queen and her mother murmured about annuities and payments and other things that Camille didn't understand. And then Brigid helped her into the carriage, where Camille sat with her hands folded on her lap, trying not to rub her dirty dress against the velvet seats. The queen leaned forward.\n\\\"You are very brave, Camille,\\\" Brigid said. \\\"Few little girls would go on a big adventure like this.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nRemember Me Not: It\u2019s Morgans first night at Davidson University. She attends there with Hanna her best friend. She is nervous about making friends. She goes to a party on her first night.\n\n#settlingin, #university, #memories, #collage, #introvert, #party, \n\nRemember Me Not\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nI'll never forget the night I met him.\nGranted, it was also the first night of college, which tends to be something that either stays with you for the rest of your life or gets lost overnight to an alcohol-induced blackout. It's the night that\u2014when you're in your forties, married to both a partner and a whole load of inescapable adult responsibilities\u2014becomes either the defining memory of the good old days, full of fun and freedom and friends, or your go-to embarrassing dinner party story about a time when you couldn't handle your liquor.\nFor me, though, I wasn't sure it would be any of those things.\nFirstly, getting wasted wasn't exactly my style. And this was a big night: the culmination of two years of anticipation, of agonizing over applications and GPAs and dorm allocations. The start of a new chapter\u2014four years at Davidson University, Massachusetts\u2014after months of discussion, preparation and hard work. That amount of pressure heaped on my shoulders meant I was not going to be on top form.\n\nDespite my hopes, the summer before college hadn't seen me metamorphose into a social butterfly, so regular old introverted me was going to have to do her best. And I knew I had to make an effort. Even if I hadn't been grudgingly aware, there were plenty of people around me who weren't about to let me forget it.\nThose first few weeks make all the difference, Mom had said, more times than I could count.\nYou won't get a second chance to make a first impression was my dad's clich\u00e9-topped wisdom.\nAnd from my older sister, Vanessa, who of course had sailed through her years at the very same college with a perfect work-life balance: You've got to put yourself out there and let people get to know the real Morgan.\nStill, none of them got the message through as effectively as my best friend, Hanna.\n\\\"Marcus down the hall said there's a welcome party downstairs tonight,\\\" she said, as we stood in our half-unpacked dorm room, the contents of our lives strewn all over the floor. We'd been at Davidson all of two hours, and somehow Hanna had already got a head start on the making-an-effort thing; while I'd been helping my parents carry the boxes up to our room, and trying to swallow over the lump in my throat at the thought of them leaving for good, she'd apparently been getting on first-name terms with our new neighbors. Marcus-down-the-hall was likely one of many new acquaintances. \\\"Sounds like it's a bit of a PG-rated, RA-organized thing, but the after party should be fun. We're going.\\\"\n\\\"We are?\\\" I asked. An innocent enough question, but Hanna could sniff out my apprehensiveness from a mile away. She raised her eyebrows. \\\"What? I didn't say anything.\\\"\n \n\\\"You didn't have to,\\\" she said. \\\"I know that look. Come on, Morgan, I know it's usually not your thing, but it's our first night of college. We can't stay in our room and not talk to anyone.\\\"\nShe was right, of course. It was one of many reasons why rooming with my best friend of eight years instead of opting for random allocation was such a good idea. A worthy contender for the world's biggest extrovert, Hanna had a knack for pushing me out of my comfort zone. While the thought of walking up to a total stranger and introducing myself filled me with utter dread, Hanna wouldn't think twice about it. We were perfectly matched polar opposites: she was exactly the kind of whirlwind force I needed, and I was always there to rein her in if necessary.\n\nSo partying with Marcus-down-the-hall it was. I knew going out and being sociable was what I was supposed to do\u2014and certainly what my mom and dad and Vanessa would want. That made it easier to play along as Hanna began her elaborate getting-ready routine, finding her curling iron and make-up bag and favorite pair of heeled boots in record timing among her half-unpacked belongings. As I watched her sit cross-legged in front of our new shared mirror, sectioning out her shoulder-length blonde hair and twisting it into loose curls, I tried to stay focused on what was familiar, rather than all the things that felt so overwhelmingly different.\nThen, it was my turn. I started to flick through the clothes Mom had hung in my new closet, in search of something that would make that all-important first impression, but Hanna's arm appeared across the door.\n\\\"Sit down,\\\" she said, her eyes twinkling like the gold ring in her nose. \\\"I've got this.\\\"\n\\\"You don't have to\u2014\\\"\n\\\"I know I don't,\\\" she countered, touching my arm. \\\"But where would be the fun in that?\\\"\nSo I sat like a statue as she poked and painted and perfected, hoping the exterior transformation might change the inside too.\n\\\"There,\\\" she said after what had to be thirty minutes, stepping aside to award me my view of the mirror. \\\"What do you think?\\\"\nI stared back at my reflection, assessing the situation. The smoky eyeshadow and dark lipstick were flawless as usual. The volume of my curly hair now looked purposeful instead of just out of control. And the black suede shoes she'd insisted I borrow did go well with the floaty shirt and jeans she'd picked out, even if my toes were squished up against the edge. This Morgan certainly looked like a girl who was ready to tackle her first night at college.\nIf only I could channel her on the inside, too. \n\\\"Hold the shower of compliments. I know I'm an angel,\\\" Hanna said, her back turned as she started picking up make-up from the floor. \\\"But if you end up hitting it off with a cute college boy tonight, I'm taking at least some of the credit.\\\"\nI shook my head and managed to smile. \\\"Not likely, Han.\\\"\n\\\"Why not? First night of college, anything could happen.\\\"\nShe glanced back over her shoulder to catch my eye, and for some reason, I felt the jolt run all the way down my spine. Just nerves, I assumed\u2014the anticipation of a night with so much riding on it. I didn't believe her. Because regardless of how perfect my eyeliner was, or how many extra inches Hanna's shoes gave me, I was still Morgan. The quiet one always who stuck to the sidelines, happy to let her best friend be the center of attention.\nThe type of anything she was talking about just didn't happen to people like me.\nI didn't know that things would be different that night.\n\nChapter 2\n\nI wanted to go home.\nBarely past midnight and already that was running through my mind, although I didn't dare admit it aloud. All night, I'd been working so hard to make sure that nothing except friendly and approachable showed on my face that it now felt ready to shatter into pieces. I couldn't hold it together much longer.\nAt first, things hadn't been so bad. The welcome party was exactly the kind of enforced fun I usually dreaded, but that actually felt like a relief in this new setting. When we got to the lounge, Hanna marched straight up to Marcus-down-the-hall's table, greeting him like they'd known each other forever, which saved us the awkwardness of finding people to sit with. His friends seemed nice, and most of them lived on the same floor. My stomach even felt settled enough to manage a couple of slices of the free pizza. By the time the RAs took their place at the front to kick off the icebreakers, I was hit by a surge of relief.\nMaybe I could handle this after all.\nBut a few hours later, when the official party started winding down, and we were swept away by a group of upperclassmen to a very much unofficial one in an apartment off campus, things went downhill.\nIt was everything that made me nervous about college, all thrown together in one dark, smoky apartment. We could barely move for the amount of people packed inside, most of them way too old to be freshmen. Sweaty bodies kept pressing up against me as they squeezed past, several lingering long enough to make me shudder, and I jumped in surprise when a knock sent someone's warm beer trickling down my back. By the time I spun around, the culprit had vanished into the crowd, leaving me alone with the sound of someone else's laugh.\nOne thing was clear: drinking wasn't optional here. Even Hanna\u2014who by now was in a giggly, tipsy state\u2014was miles behind the most sober, though she certainly wasn't shy about catching up. My own sobriety felt like a flashing neon sign above me. \n\n\n\n"}

The night was this: thundering music oozing from the speakers, squealing guitar solos and the harsh crash of drumsticks against a snare and a low bass riff twirling around somewhere behind it all. It was plastic cups brimming with Vodka or something fruity and pungent, lifted towards the twinkling stars. It was Beck's hand pressed firmly into the small of her back, his lips against her ear as he shouted over the music, \\\"Which album was this on, Im? I can't remember.\\\"\n\\\"Achilles' Heel, right?\\\"\nBeck leaned away from her, nodding in agreement. Iman watched the profile of his face as the multicolored lights slid over it, the bump on his nose that he despised and she'd barely noticed until he'd pointed it out one day (\\\"Oh, it's tragic, Iman...it makes me look like every Disney villain ever\\\") illuminated in neon pink, blue, yellow. Out of mindless desire she leaned forward and kissed him on the edge of his mouth and he grinned down at her and caught her in his arms again. The summer was something permanent.\nThe chords petered out, and the illustrious Dave P. Mackie, head vocalist of the local DC rock band Fretting Class., said something unintelligible into the mic. Perhaps it was only unintelligible to Iman because her ears were bleeding. Either way, when the crowd sent up a cheer that drew a lopsided, gap-toothed smile across Dave P. Mackie's face, Iman joined them. Her arm flew up into the air, silver rings glinting upon her slim brown fingers, and her plastic cup tipped backwards, spilling a line of pale ale down her dress.\nIman shuddered\u2014suddenly cold, sticky, uncomfortable. \\\"Oops,\\\" said Beck. He rummaged around in his pockets until he produced a wrinkled, semi-used napkin. \\\"Well\u2014I've got this.\\\"\nIman rolled her eyes at him, brushing his shoulder and thrusting what remained of her beer into his hands. \\\"You finish that. I'll be just a sec.\\\"\nBeck cast her a worried look from behind his thick-framed glasses, but nevertheless didn't stop her as she began to wade through the crowd, her eyes on the glowing white Restroom sign. \nThe air was clear, yet so was the heat. It pressed against every inch of her skin, her eyes, her hair. Iman could no longer tell which stickiness was her own sweat and which was the beer; she smoothed her lank hair up into a minuscule bun at the top of her head and fanned herself as she climbed to the edge of the amphitheater, looping around to the bathrooms. \nThe ladies' room was a smorgasbord of unpleasant scents that all together had the potential to make Iman puke. Weed, urine, and saccharine e-cigarette smoke all mingled in her nostrils; Iman shoved past a group of scantily-dressed undergraduate students and claimed a mirror. Black eyeliner smeared across her face, and she guessed that most of her lipstick had made it off of her lips and onto the rim of her cup. She rinsed off. Re-applied. Let the short curls of her hair down again and smoothed one side behind her ear, like she always did, like Beck always did on the days she forgot. She ran a finger along the scar on her neck and started to think about him but then didn't.\nShe left the bathroom.\nThere he was.\nIman couldn't shake the idea that somehow her thoughts had been the catalyst that'd summoned him, that he'd somehow heard her and had come running. For whatever reason he was there, he was there, leaned back against the old brick wall between the men's and women's restrooms with his hands underneath his armpits and a half-burnt cigarette dangling between his teeth. She had seen him many times before but there was something odd about seeing him here\u2014or now, rather. He'd been the past for so long. Someone she saw only when she wanted to. Now he was the present, too.\n\\\"Well?\\\" he said, making Iman jolt. He turned his head slowly, dark hair flopping into his eyes as he grinned at her. \\\"Were you going to say hello, Iman, or just keep ogling me like I'm some dashing stranger you'll never see again?\\\"\nIman took a moment to calculate which expression was best for the situation. She landed on mostly wary. \\\"You know who I am?\\\"\nNow it was his turn to be surprised. \\\"Of course I do. You're that time traveling lady that always pops in. Uninvited, mind you. You don't remember? First time you showed up, you broke my flower pot and I made you buy me a new one.\\\"\nA smiled bloomed across Iman's face; she stepped closer, leaning against the wall beside him. \\\"It was a very nice flower pot, Julien.

Then: \\\"Why did you think I wouldn't know you?\\\"\nIman ducked her head, studying a grayish blot on the toe of her shoe and wondering how it had gotten there. \\\"I don't know,\\\" she said. \\\"Time is\u2014is weird. I thought maybe this you, here, was before the you I travel to.\\\"\n\\\"You don't know what date you're going to when you go there?\\\"\nIman shook her head. \\\"It's not always that easy.\\\"\nJulien scoffed. \\\"Try being immortal.\\\"\n\\\"Hm. I'd rather not, actually.\\\"\nJulien laughed and tore the cigarette from his teeth, smooshing it beneath his boot and leaning over the water fountain instead. Cigarette smoke lingered in the air and on his clothes; he turned on his side, shoulder against the wall. \\\"fretting class.?\\\" he said, and chuckled. \\\"I'm sorry. I'd just never paint you as a rock fan.\\\"\n\\\"I'm not, usually. I came because my boyfriend wanted to.\\\"\nJulien's eyebrows lifted. \\\"Boyfriend? This is new.\\\"\n\\\"We haven't seen each other in six months,\\\" Iman pointed out. \\\"A lot of things are new.\\\"\nJulien opened his mouth and for a moment Iman's heart seized, worried he was going to ask the one question she was not prepared to answer. Then something flickered across his dark eyes and Iman was relieved when he said instead, \\\"So you're here with someone.\\\"\n\\\"Yes. Are you?\\\"\nJulien cast a perfunctory glance around. Until then Iman hadn't noticed how on edge he was; the frantic tap of his toes, the clench of his teeth.\n\n\n\n"}

He swung his blade in a wide arc at her unprotected right side. Skylar dodged swiftly and smashed her shield to the man's shoulder. He stumbled and fell on one knee, splashing the mud all around. \n\\\"Again!\\\" she shouted, not missing a beat. \n\\\"Skylar!\\\" a high-pitched shriek sounded. \nThe warriors looked up from training grounds, covered in mud. The scream's source was a dainty little figure dashing towards them in a whirl of the lacey pink skirt. A doll-like woman's hands formed fists shaking from barely contained fury. She stopped at the edge of the muddy field and put her fists on the hips. Despite her unimpressive height, all the men gathered in the pitch cowered instinctively. \n\\\"What on all the gods do you think you're doing?!\\\" the little woman demanded, her dark eyes throwing daggers. \n\\\"Sparring,\\\" Skylar said with a shrug, but she lowered her weapon. She smirked at her sister. \\\"Want to join me, Rori?\\\"\n\\\"Sparring? SPARRING? Do you have any idea what day it is? What time?\\\"\nSkylar slowly sheathed her sword and took off her helmet. Her dark hair was sweaty and clinging close to her head. She wiped it with her muddy forearm, no doubt leaving it even more filthy than before. \nThe stare Rori gave her expressed an utter disgust. \\\"The Royal delegation is coming to visit.\u00a0 Today! There is no telling how soon they will be here. And you, young lady, look like a disgrace!\\\"\n\\\"Ugh, I had a feeling I forgot something,\\\" Skylar muttered, handing her shield to her sparring partner. \\\"Sorry, Dun, we'll have to finish it another time. It seems I need to go and pretend to be a lady for a while.\\\"\nThe man laughed. \\\"Next time, I'll get you, Captain!\\\" \n\\\"In your dreams!\\\" \n\\\"Come on!\\\" howled Rori tapping her foot impatiently. \\\"If you are late for the feast, I swear that....\\\" \nShe was interrupted by the short signal trumpet from the main gate. \n\\\"Oh no!\\\" Rori's face paled suddenly. \\\"Oh no, please don't let it be them... Please!\\\" \nThe sound of hooves reverberated on the courtyard's stones, and an entourage of soldiers trotted towards them. At the head of the pack was a man in his late twenties, wearing a crisp red and black uniform, decorated with several silver pins. \n\\\"Oh, gods. It's him!\\\" Rori gasped. But before Skylar could pose a question about the visitors, her sister dropped her exasperated expression, putting on a mask of a beautiful lady that she was known as. \\\"Come on, Sky. We have to greet him.\\\" \n\\\"And who is he exactly?\\\" she asked, following her sister. \n\\\"It's HIM!\\\" Rori hissed, careful not to crack her perfectly charming face. \\\"The General! Gawyn Gryphonheart!\\\" \n\\\"Oh, him,\\\" Skylar murmured when the realisation finally dawned on her. She didn't care much about politics and the long list of nobles that she was expected to know. That was mainly her sister's responsibility. But that name she did recognise, as it was the man that Rori was going to marry. She felt a little stab of guilt at the thought that she embarrassed her older sister in public once again. But in the end, she didn't matter, so it would probably be fine. \nThe entourage reached the middle of the courtyard and stopped their horses. Rori stepped forward, spreading her arms in a welcoming gesture. \\\"General Gryphonheart! It is a great honour to welcome you in our humble estate.\\\" She curtseyed gracefully.\n\nThe General hopped off his horse and strolled towards them. His back was straight, his uniform crisped and perfect even after a long horseback ride. Skylar had to admit that the man was handsome, his features sharp, piercing grey eyes framed with lashes so long, it probably made most of the women green from jealousy. But even with all this picturesque beauty, Skylar felt immediate antipathy towards him. It must have been the way he poised himself. His chin high, eyes scanning his surrounding with evident distaste. Like he was far too good to be here. Which, as the youngest son of a royal family, he probably was. \nHe didn't even spare her a second glance. He stopped in front of Rori, his face carefully neutral. \\\"You must be Lady Aurora.\\\" \n\\\"Indeed, my lord,\\\" Rori said, curtseying again and then offering her hand. \nThe man took it and raised it to his mouth, barely grazing tips of her fingers with his mouth and then swiftly letting go. \\\"It's an honour to finally meet you,\\\" he said, but his voice sounded strained as if he was forcing himself to say it. \n\\\"You're early, my lord. We were expecting you later today. If we knew, we would prepare a proper greeting.\\\" \n\\\"I don't like to travel with the whole royal delegation. I thought I'd go ahead and check the premises before his Highness the King arrives.\\\" \nThat was an apparent jab at their status. As if the General didn't trust them with the monarch's safety. Skylar narrowed her eyes but only gritted her teeth at the insult. Rori did not let any of her displeasure at his words show, of course. She was too good at playing politics. \n\\\"Then it would be my pleasure to show you around.\\\" \n\\\"Don't trouble yourself with that, my Lady. I only need to meet with the Head of the Guards. Your guard can show me...\\\" He moved his eyes to Skylar and trailed off, his perfect face broken by surprise. He probably thought she was a man at first glance. It was unbecoming of noblewomen to be anything else but a lady at the court. Her in chainmail and covered with mud was probably not a common sight for the General. She met his gaze straight on and crossed her arms in a silent challenge. \nAn elegant laugh broke the awkward silence. \\\"Oh, my apologies, my Lord. Late introductions. My younger sister, Lady Skylar,\\\" Rori said with a straight face and charming smile. \n\\\"Lady Skylar?\\\" the General asked, his brows raised high and apparent displeasure written all over his face. \\\"I see.\\\" \nBefore Skylar managed to utter a word, Rori took over yet again. \\\"Oh, look. Master Jeremiah is already here!\\\" She gestured to the older man, striding towards them swiftly. \\\"I believe he is the person that you are looking for at this moment, my lord.\\\" \n\\\"Indeed. Thank you for your welcome, my lady,\\\" the General said and bowed his head just a fraction toward Rori. \\\"I will see you later at the feast.\\\" \nAnd before she could reply, he was already walking off toward Master Guardsman.\n\\\"What a prick!\\\" Skylar hissed quietly, so only her sister could hear it. \n \\\"Well, he may be a prick, all right,\\\" Rori agreed with a pleasant smile still plastered to her beautiful face. \\\"But he is my husband-to-be and one of the most influential men in this kingdom, so please hold your tongue, Sky.\\\"\n\nChapter 2\n\nSkylar was sitting in a tub full of hot water, scraping her skin with a tough brush, trying to get rid of all the mud covering her body in the weirdest places. The maids were moving about the room getting her evening dress ready. They knew better than to fuss over her. She hated that and saw no reason why she couldn't bathe or dress by herself. It seemed like such a waste of effort.\n\nShe winced as she rubbed at fresh scrapes and scratches she didn't even know were there. But the warmth of the water was doing wonders to relax her tense and exhausted muscles after the sparring session. The pain was oddly satisfying, a sign that she worked hard enough for her body to feel it. \nUnfortunately, her peaceful bath time came to an end when she heard the door to her room open and shut loudly. \n\\\"Lady Aurora.\\\" \nShe heard the maids' respectful voices, and then several more women entered her bathing chamber with Rori in her impeccable dress and fashionably styled hair. Her sister waved her hand, and her servants grabbed the brush from Skylar's hand and started to scrub her furiously from all sides.\n\\\"Hey!\\\" she protested fiercely, trying to wriggle out of the women's grasp. \\\"Get your maids off me! I don't need help to bathe!\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

Her boss is Letty.\n\n#wedding, #weddingplanner, #work, #funny,\n\nThe Planner\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\n\\\"I do.\\\"\nCue the flutter of applause, the loud cheers, and the wet-eye sniffles. Under the arbor, the couple smiles as their lips meet. With a single kiss, bride and groom become husband and wife. One perfect, beautiful moment.\nThis is what I live for. No matter how many weddings I plan meticulously, from proposal to after-party, there is something uniquely special about the moment when a bride and groom share their first kiss. For just a second, all the pain and tears, all the doubting mothers and wardrobe malfunctions and drunk Uncle Larrys-all of it is worth it. Just like that, all of my hard work culminates into a lifelong bond between two people.\nTrue love. It's a beautiful thing, and even now, attending my forty-seventh wedding, I'm a sucker for it. The bride and groom break their kiss and linger in the moment, forehead to forehead, grinning from ear to ear. The groom-Patrick Taylor-owns a men's fashion line, and you better believe the groom's side looks like a runway spread.\nThe bride, Sandy McClure, is a nobody from nowhere any other day, but today she's the sun around which everyone orbits. She's decked out in this beautiful Vera Wang, he's in one of his own smartly tailored tuxedos, and they look fit for a wedding cake. \nThis wedding is about as high profile as it gets, with cameras flashing on either side of the procession. Tomorrow, the tabloids will wax poetic about the romantic retreat tucked away under the Manhattan skyline-the arbor entwined with hydrangeas, the pearly white d\u00e9cor stitched with powder blue, and the caviar and canap\u00e9 appetizers served on silver platters. Punctuating the frilly descriptions will be a plug about how none of this would be possible were it not for Everlasting Love, boutique wedding planning-that is, if Letty Prichard has a say in it, and Letty Prichard has a say in everything.\nLetty stands beside me in the back row as we watch the wedding unfold. Outdoor weddings are a nightmare to pull together, but when the sun shines just right through the trees and the swans dance lazy circles in the lake behind the couple, it gets me misty-eyed. I discreetly dab the corner of my eye with a napkin embroidered with the couple's initials.\nEven Letty is crying. I'm touched. Letty Prichard, in her own words, has a heart made of ice. She's the only one who can get away with wearing black to a wedding. Letty is in her midforties and as fierce as they come; today, she's sporting a dark bob with an edge so straight it looks like it was cut with a single swipe of an axe. I've never seen her actually get emotional at a wedding before, and I'm not quite sure how to handle it now, so I ask, \\\"Letty, are you okay?\\\"\n\\\"It's over,\\\" she weeps, tears falling through her laughter. \\\"It's finally over.\\\"\nI'm sandwiched between Letty and her lead planner, Thom. He is quiet in his perfectly tailored navy suit, his eyes darting like a hawk's hunting for the slightest imperfection in his design. I nudge him with my elbow, and he leans over to bridge the foot-and-a-half-size gap between us.\n\\\"The setup was that bad, huh?\\\" I ask.\n\\\"You have no idea,\\\" he groans under his breath. His voice is smooth and velvety and topped with a posh British accent that makes it sound like he's reading off the dessert menu. Of course, like all men I find attractive, he's woefully unattainable-utterly and proudly gay.\nThom nods to the stage. \\\"The circus isn't quite over yet.\\\"\nMy skin tingles all over. It physically hurts to keep myself from jumping in the fray with them. Thom's eyes lock on me, and I'm sure he can see my struggle. He's always been able to see right through me. He bumps me with his shoulder. \\\"Are you sure you're ready to make a comeback?\\\"\n\\\"I couldn't be readier.\\\"\nThom side-eyes me suspiciously. \\\"Ace is...?\\\"\n\\\"Gone with the wind. It's over between us. I've closed that chapter.\\\"\n\\\"Right.\\\" Thom does not sound convinced. \\\"So no boys?\\\"\nI hold up my palms. \\\"No boys.\\\"\n\\\"They make you insane,\\\" he huffs. \\\"Hunting for your precious Prince Charming like bloody King Arthur looking for the Holy Grail, waving Excalibur around.\\\"\n\\\"I don't come at them with a sword.\\\" I squint at him. \\\"It doesn't matter anyway. This gal is flying sane and solo.\\\"\n\\\"That's my girl.\\\" Thom gives me a playful pat on the rear, which makes me squeak with surprise.\n\\\"Uh...Miss Prichard?\\\" We all hear the hesitant voice as it crackles in from the Letty's handheld radio. \\\"There's a...situation.\\\"\nLetty's tears stop instantly. She unhooks her radio from her belt and speaks into it. \\\"What situation?\\\"\n\\\"The birds won't uh...release.\\\"\n\\\"They're birds, Marlee. Poke them with a damn stick.\\\"\nI squint over the gaudy hats and too-tall hairdos before I see her. Marlee, all double french braids and Little-House-on-the-Prairie-chic, is crouched at the edge of the stage holding an open cage with two birds inside of it. She's trying to wave them out, but they just flutter and pace anxiously at the back of the cage.\n\\\"But they peck,\\\" Marlee whines.\n\\\"They're about to step off the procession. Now or never, Marlee!\\\" Letty barks into the radio.\n\\\"Let me help,\\\" I plead.\nLetty shoots me a glare that nearly turns me into one of the ice sculptures. \\\"Don't you dare. Don't make me remind you that you're still benched. No one touches a single tassel until I tell them to, understood?\\\"\nMeanwhile, out of the corner of my eyes, I see Marlee shake the cage roughly. The doves flutter around frantically and burst out. They don't quite make it to the beautiful arc through the sky, however; instead, they flop around, confused. One manages to get caught under a bridesmaid's umbrella dress, causing the woman to flail and shriek, while the second bird topples onto the pastor's bible and wing-slaps him before it rockets up into the sky.\nLetty swears and jumps into action immediately. \\\"I want those birds quartered and shot and served up for dinner!\\\" she snaps. \\\"Thom! I need you now!\\\"\n\\\"Pardon me,\\\" Thom says as he retreats with a wink. \\\"I've got pigeons to kill.\\\"\n\\\"Make it painless!\\\" I joke back, knowing full well Thom couldn't hurt a fruit fly. Before he dashes off, however, I grab his arm. \\\"And Thom...get the band going.\\\"\nHe knits his eyebrows. \\\"They've already finished their set.\\\"\n\\\"Tell them to improvise.\\\"\nThe idea catches up with him, and his eyes light up. \\\"You're a genius.\\\" His eyes crinkle with quiet amusement. \\\"It's good to have you back. Welcome back to the madhouse, darling,\\\"\n\\\"You're not kidding.\\\" I watch as chaos erupts on stage as Letty snaps at Marlee, who chases the birds around while the bridesmaid cries.\nIt takes them less than a minute to scare away the pigeons and redirect everyone's attention to the brassy boom of the band. That's because Letty and her Everlasting Love team are the best wedding planners in the business.\nIt takes an army to bring two people together. I'm part of that army. At least I was, until I took a mental health break for the better part of last year. But I'm back in the business-recently reenlisted, so to speak. That is, if Letty will have me back.\n\\\"Susie!\\\" Marlee pops in front of me, and I blink back to reality. She's short of breath, arms covered in beak-marks, and shoves a manila folder at me. \\\"Letty told me to give this to you before you go.\\\"\n\\\"Thanks, Mar-\\\" As soon as I take it, Marlee dashes back into the fray. No doubt off to find the offending pigeons. Letty has to eat, after all.\nI turn the folder in my hands. It's thick with loose pages. The top tab reads: DALTON/WEST.\nIt's a wedding assignment. The first since my hiatus.\nTime to prove to them that I'm back in business. Look out, world. Here comes Susie Posy, wedding planner extraordinaire.\n\n\n\n"}

She could hear the sounds from upstairs and knew that her mother would be down soon. \nHer eight-year-old brother didn't reply. Instead, he stuffed his mouth with a final spoon-full of cheerios before laying his spoon to the side. He chewed on it noisily before swallowing it down.\n\\\"I'm done.\\\"\n\\\"Finally,\\\" Diana murmured irritably as she bent down next to him and began adjusting his school uniform. But she knew it wasn't his fault. She had been the one to wake up late. She was responsible for making his breakfast and getting him ready for school.\n\\\"There,\\\" Diana exclaimed, adjusting Tyler's white collar before standing up straight, releasing a breath of relief. \nAt that moment, fast-approaching footsteps were heardon the stairs and the breath Diana had just released seemed to be caught in her throat all over again. It wasn't long before her mother came into view. \n\\\"Tyler, are you ready?\\\" her mother asked, placing her hardback heavily on the kitchen table as she began rummaging through it for her keys. \n\\\"Good morning, mom.\\\" \nNo reply. Diana felt her blood boil steadily as she watched her nonchalant mother before her. She hadn't even acknowledged her presence, hadn't even acknowledged that she had said anything at all to her. A few moments passed and Diana slowly felt the anger escaping from her. There was no point in being angry. After all, what did she expect? This was nothing new. This was exactly the way things had been for a while. \n\\\"Mom, I'm ready,\\\" Tyler responded, oblivious to the light tension in the air as he got up from his seat and raced out of the kitchen to retrieve his school bag from his bedroom. \nIt was then that Diana's mom looked up from rummaging through her handbag and glanced at her daughter, her eyes lingering over her from top to bottom. \n\\\"Is that what you're going to wear to school?\\\" her mom asked. The judgement and distaste was clear in her voice, and it took everything within Diana to keep from rolling her eyes. \n\\\"Yeah. Why?\\\"\nHer mom just shook her head in reply and went back to rummaging through her handbag. Diana stood there, rubbing her palms awkwardly against her pants, unsure of what to do. There was nothing really bad about the way she was dressed. She was wearing an oversized shirt and cargo pants, but her mom just seemed to disapprove of everything she did.\n\\\"Mom, I'm ready for school!\\\"\nTyler had reappeared in the kitchen with his backpack, and Diana couldn't keep from smiling at how adorable he looked. Her brother was basically a carbon-copy of herself, except younger and male. He was dressed in his school uniform, a white polo shirt and navy blue shorts, and as corny as Diana believed the whole 'uniform' thing to be, she couldn't deny the fact that it added to his overall cuteness.\n\\\"Oh, honey, look how cute you look.\\\" \nImmediately a small scowl etched unto Diana's face as her mom began cooing over her younger brother. It was true. He did look cute, and Diana knew it. But as she stared at the manner by which her mother papered Tyler, a feeling of resentment began building up within her. This feeling was short-lived and soon disappeared as if it were never even there. Diana felt guilt eating up within her. Her strained relationship with her mother had nothing to do with Tyler.\n\\\"We'd be on our way,\\\" Diana's mom stated as she grabbed her handbag off the kitchen table and took hold of Tyler's hand in hers. \n\\\"Bye Di-di!\\\" Tyler said, waving energetically at her, and Diana couldn't help the wide smile that crossed her face. She could tell that he was excited for his first day of 3rd Grade, it had been all that he had been talking about for the first week. Diana was happy for him, she knew that he would have a good time. He had friends at school, he was smart, his teachers loved him. Unlike her, he didn't resent the educational system.\n \nDiana felt a dark feeling come over her as she thought about school. She had been so focused on getting her brother ready for school that she had almost forgotten that today was the first day of the new school year for her as well. Suddenly feeling slightly dizzy, Diana made her way over to the kitchen island. \nThe house was eerily quiet now that she was the only one at home. As usual, her father was away on some business trip in only God-knows-where. Diana closed her eyes and breathed in deeply, trying to calm her nerves.\nSenior Year. This was something she had once looked forward to, something she had once yearned for with excitement. But now, she yearned for it to be over. She yearned to be done with high school, for it to be over and dusted with. As far as Diana was concerned, high school was hell.\nYou only have to get through this year, and you'd be done. Diana whispered to herself. You'd be over with this for good. \nThis calmed Diana down, but the calm was short-lived as she opened her eyes back up and caught sight of the clock hanging above the kitchen stove. \nShit. \nDiana was in her room in an instant, stuffing notebooks and pencils into her backpack. She was running late; the school bus was going to arrive any moment soon. \nMaking her way out of her room, Diana took in the state of the kitchen. It definitely wasn't what would be considered a \\\"mess\\\", but she definitely knew that I would be what her mom would continue to be a \\\"mess\\\". Diana hesitated for a few moments, unsure of what to do. If her mom arrived home before her and saw the state of the kitchen, she was going to be in big trouble. The last thing she needed to do was to give her mom a reason to be mad at her, seeing as she had so much already. \n\\\"Fuck it, I'll do it later,\\\" Diana grumbled to herself as she made her way out the front door. She was instantly hit by the warm August air, but Diana didn't have time to take it in. She began walking quickly, checking the time on her phone as she did so, making her way over to the bus stop. Soon enough, she had broken into a light jog, panting slightly as she rushed to arrive before the school bus. \nToo Late.\nJust as Diana turned the corner, she saw the familiar yellow-and-black striped bus retreating from the stop. \n\\\"Great. Just fucking great,\\\" Diana cursed as she watched the bus appear smaller and smaller till it finally disappeared into the distance. She let out an exasperated breath before readjusting her bag over her shoulders and beginning the trek to school. \nBy the time Diana arrived at school, the hallways were already cleared. No doubt, all the other students were already seated in their classrooms, which was where she was meant to be. At the same time, Diana felt a slight relief. Not only was she sweating and panting heavily, but she had some time to recollect herself before having to face anyone. \n\\\"Diana Williams,\\\"\nTurning her head quickly, Diana let out a sigh of relief once she came face-to-face with Mr Jones, an art teacher. Also, probably the only person at the school that she could stand. \n\\\"Mr Jones,\\\" Diana said, acknowledging him. \n\\\"You're late, on your first day,\\\" Mr Jones said as he approached her. Although his voice was stern, he had a sly smile dangling from his lips, \\\"that can't be a good sign.\\\"\n\\\"I know,\\\" Diana murmured, \\\"rough morning.\\\"\nMr Jones had now completely stopped in front of her, nodding his head slightly as he regarded her. He was a white man in his mid-forties, dressed in a button-up shirt with a brown beard, which he now reached up to scratch.\n\\\"You're lucky I'm the one on duty,\\\" Mr Jones said, smiling slightly. \\\"But don't be late again or it'd be a detention.\\\"\nDiana nodded her head, thanking him briefly. She turned on her heel, ready to walk down the opposite side of the hallway. \n\\\"One more thing Diana, I have an important task for you this year.\\\"\nDiana paused in her tracks, looking up at him, slightly confused. Mr Jones was just about to speak when he caught sight of Stefan waltzing in through the school's main entrance. \n\\\"Stefan, you're late!\\\" Mr Jones yelled out. \nStefan didn't even acknowledge him, but continued making his way down the corridor. He was dressed in his varsity jacket and had his hands lying idly in his pockets; your typical high-school jock. \n\\\"Diana, we'll talk about this later,\\\" Mr Jones said, brushing past her and running down the corridor after Stefan. \nDiana watched after him for a few moments, wondering what he was going to tell her. She brushed it off after a couple seconds, realizing that there was nothing she could do about it then. It didn't help the fact that she was already almost twenty minutes late for her first-period class. \nTurning on her heels, Diana made her way towards the English classroom, wondering what horrors the new school year had in store for her.\n\n\n\n"}

Where the trees grow shallow roots so that they may better creep after their prey. Where the animals are of other, changing, vicious things unrecognizable except to the most unrelenting of eyes. And a thousand winding paths lead you perhaps to your destiny and perhaps to much crueler fates. The wind whips through the trees and slices deep into the raw skin of anyone who dares to lose themselves there, and even the soil made of bone meal and bog lies in wanting. This is The Forest of Linger: The place where all In-Between things find their home and forget they had any other.\nThere is a lake, deep in the Forest of Linger where few dare to venture. Its surface is the blackest grey even on the brightest of days and the sunlight never reaches more than a few inches below its murky surface. The bottom is littered with little black stones, both jagged and smooth, but all of the deepest obsidian. And beneath its depths, shifting ever so gently with the current, are The Others, grey and listless, shoulder to shoulder with pale eyes upturned and watching, mouths gaping and wanting. They linger there in the In-Between, whispering secrets to anyone willing the put their ear to the surface of the Lake. They are The Others, The People of the Lake, forged in some deep dark obsession, waiting in the murky depths for the memories of others to bring them back to life.\nThere is a house, far up on the hill where no one but the crows dare to venture. The moors on which it lives, because make no mistake, it lives, are in a constant state of fall. Leaves not dead, but not quite alive, much like every other inhabitant of the grounds. Tall flowing grass more grey than green ripples out like waves in a storm under deep grey skies, and only the evergreens are vibrant and looming in the crisp almost-rain air. Behind the cool walls and moth covered windows, in a million shades of dusk, something creeps. Something feral who speaks only in hushed rasping tones to the moths and the other In-Between creatures that keep it company in the dark.It stalks the halls of its home watching the forest as it watches back, lost god of the unseen hiding at the edge of everything. This is The Guardian, The Wraith, forged in wrath in the wake of an unrelenting darkness that stirs gently inside its chest.\u00a0\nThis is a cursed place. An In-Between place. A corner of your eye place. And nothing ever comes here without some grander design and intervention. But not all searching things wait to be chosen, and many do not seek the permission of forgotten gods before creeping into unknown, secret places on adventures of their own. This is the In-Between. Great devourer of aether, essence, bone, and marrow. And it is waking.\n\nChapter 2\n\nBlack wings, beautiful and powerful. The smell of pine and salt and earth just after a fall rain. A crown of god's teeth and crow feathers. Bone and marrow and gasping shaking breaths. Loss, crushing and endless. My eyes flew open and I took a deep breath, steadying myself. Just a dream. Just another dream. I took a practiced deep breath and uncurled my hands from the fists they'd been molded into. I dreaded those dreams, vicious and unrelenting. They left me with a tight chest, a voice raw from screaming, and a whisper somewhere far in the back of my mind that I'd forgotten something vital, that something was coming for me and I'd forgotten the one thing I needed to save myself. Another breath in, another out and my chest eased, the voice quieted.\n\nI wandered down the creaking wood stairs and out to the still dark garden I'd spent an eternity tending, to harvest the few herbs that looked good that morning. There was never much, but always just enough. I guess that's by design here in the In-Between. Everything is just that: In-Between. Never more. Never less. Never concretely one thing or another. I guess that's what one should expect out of a place that is between one thing and the next. It's kind of like a comma, just an unassuming little mark, the bare minimum to get you from one grand idea to the next one. Nothing more than exactly what it needs to be. And for me: home. \nBack inside I poured six steaming cups of tea in my modest little kitchen and arranged them all carefully on a tarnished silver serving tray. Sometimes it was peppermint, sometimes lavender or lemon balm or chamomile, but always just what was needed. This morning it was the lemon balm, soothing and energetic. Then, up the stairs and out onto the roof, I put each cup in their place and settled in just as the sun's first light cast an eerie pale glow across the moors. One cup on the farthest ledge, one on the chair in the corner, and three evenly spaced across from my chair at the cracked oak table overlooking the moors. That's how they liked them. Then, a handful of sleepy moths alighting in my hair and across my shoulders, we waited. \t\n\nAs each one arrived, they placed their packages off to the side and took their place on the rooftop. First to arrive was always Kieran, followed by Finn and Lachlan, black wings stark against the pale morning sky. Kieran perched on the edge of the table directly across from me, Finn on the chair in the corner, and Lachlan on the far edge. Then, tearing through the sky, snipping at each other's feathers, came Clay and Declan. Clay, the youngest, landed neatly beside Kieran and ruffled his feathers while Declan flew over to me, nipping at my hair and bumping my shoulder before strutting over to claim the cup on the right-hand side of Kieran. \nTheir chattering, a million clicks and caws filled the air like music around me and I listened, rapt as they told me all their adventures, Declan and Clay animatedly reenacting each scene while Kieran rolled his eyes. It didn't take long for Lachlan to join in and Finn was just a step behind, a little quieter, a little more reserved, but still happy to be there. They carried on like that until even Kieran was laughing and I sat there, just soaking it in, the stories, the chaos, the laughter. I loved it all. Sometimes I'd perch on the edge of my seat, shushing Kieran when he cut in, sometimes I laughed along with them, and sometimes I'd just listen quietly, my mind wandering to other places even though I wanted to be there in the moment. This was one of those days and I felt my mind wandering past them even as I tried so hard to focus as they each presented me with whatever trinkets they'd found on their most recent adventure. Mostly it was thick volumes of histories, adventures, romances, and other scraps of writing they could find, but they still brought me the occasional doorknob, river rock, charred oak branch, or whatever other miscellaneous items caught their eyes. Declan insisted that I receive his first as always, and Kieran, like usual, waited until each of the others had presented theirs. I smiled, examining each one in turn, careful not to betray which was my favorite, and then they began their bickering about who had chosen the best gift. This was the game we played every morning and while this morning I found myself a little distant, it was still nice to have this little piece of normal.They kept up their bickering until the air turned crisp around us and raw instinct stilled every living creature within miles of the moors. Breath held, we turned to watch as I retrieved my little blue book from under the table and began scratching the day's entries into the pressed pages.\n\n\n\n"}

She was well and truly screwed.\nWith the hood of her NYU sweatshirt pulled tight over her head, she made it from her last class at Tisch all the way to Senior House in record time. She gripped the camera around her neck as she zipped down the hall so it wouldn't swing from side to side.\nDaniela stopped just outside her room, thoughts on her senior project\u2014a nude introspective.\nHer mother's voice\u2014may she rest in peace\u2014echoed in her head. Dani, if you want a job, you need to graduate. That was the way in the Philippines. Grade School. High School. Then College. No exceptions. \n\\\"Pakshet,\\\" she muttered again under her breath, wiping her hands against her jeans. With trembling fingers, she reached for the scrunchy-clad knob and pushed her way in.\n\\\"Silvie?\\\" She squinted into the gloom. \\\"You here?\\\"\nA gasp, a thump, and several muffled curses greeted her entrance.\n\\\"Silvie, why is it so dark in here?\\\" She shut the door and flicked the light switch. \\\"You wouldn't believe\u2014\\\"\nThe sight of a half-naked boy on the floor interrupted the rest of her sentence. Eyes wide, she stumbled against the door, her heart in her mouth, preventing a scream from coming out.\nSilvia covered herself with her comforter, raised a hand, and said, \\\"Dani, breathe. That's it, sweetie. In and out. Nothing happening here.\\\"\nDaniela scratched grooves on the door as the boy pulled up his pants without fully straightening from his crouched position. Not bothering to buckle his belt, he felt around for his shirt.\nSilvia threw it at him and said, \\\"Dani, sweetie, I'm going to need you to move to your bed.\\\"\nShe swallowed her heart back down and nodded, ignoring the barely dressed boy ready to bolt. She splayed her hands behind her and inched her way to her bed. A meter seemed like a mile, and each breath she took in an attempt to calm herself increased the light-headedness she already felt after cutting the walk-time from class to West 13th Street to under ten minutes.\nOnce she cleared the doorway, the boy jumped from his crouched position and escaped, slamming the door behind him. \nDaniela yelped and fell across her bed. She covered her eyes with her hands; unbidden tears streamed down her face. Images of broken glass and crushed metal forced her to roll to the edge of her bed. She grabbed the wastebasket by her desk and heaved the last of her lunch into the bowels of its stainless steel. \nShe flinched when a gentle hand touched her back.\n\\\"Dani, it's me,\\\" Silvia said.\nDaniela heaved again, filling the room with a sour stench. Silvia pushed aside the curtains and opened a window, letting the frigid New York air the tropical blood coursing beneath her morena skin would never get used to. While she coughed into the wastebasket, her best friend pulled on a nightshirt long enough to cover everything that needed covering. Then she sat back on Daniela's bed.\n\\\"I'm so sorry,\\\" she said behind the back of the hand she used to wipe her lips. \\\"I should have remembered what the scrunchy on the knob meant.\\\"\nSilvia shook her head. \\\"It's not your fault. I should have sent you a text first.\\\"\nMiserable laughter left her throat. \\\"You don't need to ask my permission to have s-s-s\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Mark understands,\\\" she interrupted.\n\\\"H-h-h-he does?\\\"\n\\\"He knows that if he wants to get with this,\\\" Silvia swept a hand down her body, \\\"he needs to follow the rules.\\\"\n\\\"I don't want to be this way. I seriously don't!\\\"\n\\\"You can't help what happened to you, Dani. Irresponsible scum like that don't deserve to live, but you're still here and you're learning to become strong again. You managed not to scream this time. That's a success in my book.\\\"\n\\\"Now you're just patronizing me.\\\" Daniela sat up and dried her face with her sleeves.\n\\\"I'm not.\\\" Silvia eyed her. \\\"What's up? You're usually less distracted than this.\\\"\nShe stiffened when the thought of her final project replaced images of Mark's bare chest. Tears threatened to fill her eyes again.\n\\\"What's the matter, Dani?\\\"\n\\\"Final projects were given out today.\\\" Her throat constricted. \\\"I can't do it. I'm taking the next flight back to Manila and finding some freelance job that doesn't need a degree. Maybe I'll get by on wedding photography . . . I'll figure something out.\\\"\n\\\"Hey.\\\" Silvia inched closer without touching her. \\\"It can't be that bad. What about your dream of becoming a famous photographer who takes pictures of equally famous people?\\\"\nDaniela's gaze fell to the checkered duvet. She drew circles on the soft fabric with her fingertip. She talked nonstop about becoming a famous photographer since coming to America. She won every photography competition she entered. None of that meant anything if she couldn't turn in her final project.\nSilvia let her hand hover above hers, which signaled she wanted her attention without the need for words or touch. \nWhen Daniela met her gaze, she asked, \\\"What's the project about?\\\"\n\\\"I need to create a ten-piece introspective.\\\"\n\\\"Not seeing the source of the freak out here. You've done those before, haven't you?\\\"\nShe shook her head. \\\"Not nude and not with a male subject.\\\"\n\\\"Can't you ask for a different model for your project?\\\"\n\\\"All assignments are final. My professor said I could wait until next semester, but that's way too long from now, I'll be wasting months. If I don't have the photos by the end of this semester, I'm not graduating in the spring.\\\"\n\\\"Okay, okay, don't cry.\\\" \nSilvia raised both hands, warding off another flood. She looked around their small room. Then her gaze landed on the glossy cover of a magazine at the foot of her bed.\n\\\"Why are you smiling?\\\" Daniela followed her friend's gaze.\nForgetting her aversion to touch, Silvia grabbed Daniela's forearms and squeezed. She hissed, forcing herself not to pull away. Her friend let go immediately and crossed her arms over her chest, her smile exposing straight teeth.\n\\\"I have the perfect solution to part of your problem,\\\" she said. \nThe hint of mischief in her friend's eyes made Daniela even more nervous. \n\\\"I'm going to play that card,\\\" Silvia added.\nDaniela's eyes widened. \\\"You wouldn't!\\\"\n\\\"If it's a male model you need then a male model is what you're going to get. Besides, he owes me one.\\\"\nFor a moment, Daniela wondered if there was anything left in her stomach to puke into the wastebasket. Pakshet, indeed.\n\n\n\n"}

He gets a call from his cousin to ask for a favour.\n\n#model #shoot #unrequited #love #romance, #funny\n\nThe Models\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nWith the tip of his finger, Lucas tilted the chin of the woman seated across from him and did his best to ignore the enthusiastic chitters of the designer and the stylist standing behind the photographer they hired for that day's shoot. He also pretended not to see the blush that crept across the woman's face. If she ruined the shot because she couldn't keep her lust to herself and Lucas was forced to stay longer in the rundown apartment chosen as a backdrop, he'd lock her in the bathroom and walk out. \nAt least he could count on the level-headedness of the photographer. The magazine didn't pay him an obscene fee to ogle the models. Although, sleeping with them after the shoot was fair game.\n\\\"That's good, Lucas,\\\" he encouraged.\nA series of clicks and flashes followed his words.\n\\\"Lean into her more,\\\" he said.\nLucas did as he was told, looking into the other model's eyes. She, on the other hand, stared slightly off-center. Not quite meeting his gaze. \n\\\"That's good.\\\" More clicks. \\\"Okay, Olga, put your arm over his shoulder. You're lovers. Show me the heat.\\\"\nLucas suppressed a grimace. He and Olga worked together many times, and her overenthusiasm to please sickened him. Where was her sense of pride in her work? What should be innocent touches turned into gropes and caresses.\nHe blamed it on her age. She reached that breakpoint where models usually retired. Someone younger always waited in the wings to take her place.\n\\\"Give it to me, Lucas,\\\" the photographer said.\nHaving enough of Olga's none too subtle advances\u2014she practically shoved her hand down his pants\u2014Lucas cupped her face with one hand while he pulled her close with his arm around her waist. He tilted her chin all the way up, exposing the column of her neck. The instant his lips touched her hammering pulse point, a series of flashes went off.\n\\\"That's a wrap, everyone!\\\" the photographer announced and a round of applause followed.\nLucas let go of Olga like she burned him and stood up. She glared at him, her insult not quite reaching the muscles still deadened by Botox on her face. How she could still emote baffled him. He removed the jacket and handed it to the designer who appeared by his side as if by magic.\n\\\"Magnificent as always, Lucas,\\\" the designer said, undressing him with his eyes.\nHe tried not to show the cringe that crawled over his face. \\\"Thank you, Marcus. Your clothes are always a pleasure to wear.\\\"\nThe designer stared up at him like the clouds parted and a deity floated down from the heavens. The expression on the designer's face held nothing PG behind it. Why were people in fashion so damn horny? It was a veritable orgy every time he walked onto the set. \n\\\"A bunch of us are grabbing drinks later,\\\" Marcus said when he finally managed to string words together again.\nLucas raised his hand to stop the rest of the designer's words. He'd heard the offer often enough. \n\\\"Thank you, but I have somewhere I need to be.\\\" He moved toward the designated dressing area.\n\\\"Don't think I didn't see what you did back there,\\\" the photographer whispered when Lucas passed him.\n\\\"And what exactly is that?\\\" The ghost of a grin flitted across his lips.\nThe photographer laughed. \\\"Get out of here before everyone in this room forgets the sexual harassment seminar they attended.\\\"\n\\\"Does that include you?\\\"\n\\\"Don't tempt me.\\\"\nLucas patted him on the shoulder then unbuttoned his shirt on the way to the dressing area.\n\\\"Tease,\\\" he heard the photographer say under his breath.\nLucas found modeling by accident. He was walking aimlessly around the city one morning and stumbled upon a photo shoot. Minding his own business, Lucas intended to keep moving. Fate made other plans. \nThe photographer wasn't getting the shot he wanted with the model. He turned around just in time to catch a glimpse of Lucas. Apparently, the light hit his blond curls at just the right angle. \nIn less than ten minutes, Lucas was signing release forms and posing against a brick wall filled with street art. Not an hour later, he was scooped up by an agency. And the rest led to that afternoon.\nNo matter how thankful he was, every time he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he wondered if his life still held meaning. The gigs paid the bills. The fame wasn't too bad either\u2014it kept him working. But he felt useless and, dare he admit, somewhat hopeless. \nModeling hardly fulfilled him anymore. Deep down, no matter how much he enjoyed the process, something was missing. He wore clothes and posed for a living. Rinse and repeat.\nLucas frowned as he zipped his leather jacket and pulled the beanie lower over his head. He thought modeling would help him find what he was looking for that morning he wandered the city. Instead it took him down another road. Filled with more questions than answers.\nHis cellphone rang the moment his driver closed the door to his town car. \nLucas fished out the device and tapped the screen. \\\"Hello?\\\"\n\\\"Hey, Cuz,\\\" the voice of his uncle's daughter trilled in his ear.\n\\\"Which police station do I have to bail you out from now, Carly?\\\" he asked.\n\\\"How dare you!\\\" Then she paused before she said, \\\"But fair.\\\"\nHe heard the smile in her defeat. \\\"Knowing who your mother is, I wouldn't put it past you to get into some kind of trouble.\\\"\n\\\"I'm sure my mother would love to hear you say that to her face.\\\"\nLucas didn't bother hiding his cringe. Victoria would never let him live down teasing her straight-A daughter. Carly Adara Duvall was the center of her parents' world. Might as well call her untouchable. It surprised Lucas to no end how she stayed grounded despite the rotten spoiling she got from her doting parents; not to mention her two incredibly wealthy and influential grandfathers.\nLucas chuckled.\n\\\"What's so funny?\\\"\n\\\"You're one lucky girl, do you know that?\\\" He watched the scenery change from rundown to affluent as the car neared the building where he lived.\n\\\"Dad reminds me every day of my young life.\\\"\nThe humor in her voice warmed his heart. If anyone hurt Carly, he would punch first and ask questions later. For her, he would do anything. End the world if need be.\nA thump and a curse pulled him from his thoughts.\n\\\"Everything okay?\\\" he asked, concern growing in his chest.\nSilvia seemed to have covered the receiver with her hand because her response came out muffled. It didn't matter. The powerful microphones of cellphones nowadays picked up everything. He still heard her as if she spoke to him directly.\n\\\"Trust me,\\\" she said, hissing at someone else.\n\\\"I don't like that look on your face,\\\" a lilting voice replied.\n\\\"How long have you known me?\\\"\n\\\"Not long enough to entrust my future to you.\\\"\n\\\"Ouch!\\\"\nLucas suppressed another smile by pressing his lips together. He loved Carly, but whoever she spoke to was right. He'd think twice before trusting her too. She was her mother's daughter after all.\n\\\"Cuz?\\\"\nHis attention returned to her. \\\"What is it?\\\"\n\\\"Are you coming to the party tomorrow night?\\\"\nHe sighed. \\\"I think your father would disown me if I didn't.\\\"\n\\\"Good.\\\"\nA golden eyebrow rose. \\\"And why is that?\\\"\n\\\"I need your help with something.\\\"\nThe mischief in her voice, the same one he heard in his own countless times before, worried Lucas. His gut urged him to run away. He knew the moment he said yes to his sweet devil of a cousin there was no turning back.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nVampire Hunter: Olivia Byrne meets Benjamin Cross in the British Library. He was a vampire hunter researching vampires.\n\n#vampire, #London, #romance, #love, #fantasy,\n\nVampire Hunter\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nAugust 2021\n\\\"You're in my seat,\\\" I said to him. Long legs stretched out under the table, lanky frame supported by the wall, he briefly glanced up from his book to meet my tired gaze. \n\\\"Excuse me?\\\" he replied, voice laced with animosity. Curly brown locks extended past his chin, only accentuating his porcelain skin and iridescent blue eyes.\n\\\"I said, you're in my seat,\\\" I repeated. I don't know why his choice of placement in the library irked me so much. I mean, there were plenty of other available seats. But this was my spot. Right at the back corner by the mythology section. \nThe day I met Benjamin Cross started almost like any day, until it did not. But it also could have gone many different ways.\nI awoke as per usual with an all-consuming sense of dread that I had forgotten something important. But as the light filtering through my curtains reminded me it was all a dream, a few deep breaths began to ease the panic. Then, as I continued with my usual routine, the rhythm lulled me into a sense of peace.\nGetting ready in my typical manner, I had a shower, blow-dried my copper red hair, applied some makeup to disguise my pigmentation scars and lightly coloured eyebrows and lashes, then finally popped in my headphones before heading out the door onto the bustling streets of London.\nWhile the cool summer morning caressed my face and had me huddling into my jumper, the looming 'hotspell' was the number one topic of passers-by as I headed towards the bus stop.\nI took the usual double-decker bus at 8am from Highgate Station to the British Library, grabbed my obligatory iced coffee, all just in time to enter the building as it opened its doors to the public.\nBy the time I headed up the flight of stairs with all going to plan, I was in a state of calm, almost having forgotten the sense of impending doom I had awoken to. \nBut then I rounded the corner and saw him.\n\\\"I didn't see your name on it,\\\" he snarkily replied, voice thick with British inflections. He looked no older than twenty, no older than me.\nHeaving a sigh, I realised it wasn't worth my time fighting with someone over something so trivial. Finally regaining a sense of composure, I turned to leave my usual table, but not before glancing over his pile of books (ridiculously large and widely resourced for someone who only arrived a minute after the place opened). As I perused his stack, my eyes widened slightly.\u00a0 Every single book focussed on one topic in particular: vampires.\nThrowing the confusion from my head, I walked over to the neighbouring table and set up my station. Notebook in the middle. Pens to the right. Pencil case to the left. Laptop to the front. Then I got up and began my search.\nJust as my morning had a routine, my day also had a routine, as did my week. Every weekday morning I would come to the library to research various mythological creatures through lore books, myth texts, fiction, supposed non-fiction, and fables, building my arsenal of knowledge to compose the perfect characters. \nOn Monday and Wednesday afternoons though, I would do one of two things. If the weather permitted, I would go to the park to work on my book, though if clouds or drizzle threatened my plans, I would do the same thing at home.\nOn Tuesday afternoons I went to my writer's club where we would discuss our progress and set another goal for our week. The tiny sense of community and socialisation kept me sane in my new solitude life. I was far from home in this foreign land, yet I also thrived on the lack of attention Londoners afforded. Being alone meant no one could ever hurt me. \nOn Thursday and Friday afternoons I would do a half-day shift at the bookstore (my part-time job gave me spending money to get my way through uni). Then Saturday and Sunday meant full-day shifts.\n\nThe familiarity of each day, the predictability, was all I had to ease the sense of dread that welled inside me, like I was missing something more in my life. I just didn't know what it was. Each night I went to sleep, I dreamt the same dream and awoke with no recollection, just the pain that remained. \nAs I returned to my new table that Thursday morning, still a little bitter that my routine had been disrupted, I placed my first book on my lap and got to work filling my notes on today's focal mythological creature: witches.\nBut as the minutes ticked on and I read and reread the same paragraph, my hand began to incessantly tap against my leg under the desk. Today wasn't right because of him and I just didn't get how things could have gone so wrong. I followed every single ritual to a tee. I was standing in front of those doors as they unlocked them. So how had he made it up so quickly, collected that many books, and taken my seat?\nWith the thoughts niggling at my mind, I begrudgingly lifted my gaze to him, shooting daggers across the room. But the venom was instantly replaced with confusion as I noticed his original pile of books had been pushed to the edge of the table\u2014as though he was done with them\u2014and a new stack was now right next to him. He thumbed through the pages with such ferociousness, like he was desperate for an answer to something, anything. \nBut then his eyes snapped up to mine.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Each morning before he heads off to work, Jacob confirms his affection for me. His cologne, subtle. The perfect amount. He even has the courtesy to stay away before he's brushed his teeth. No thank you morning breath. He leans in, fresh-breathed, fresh-scented, whispers I love you, and all the while I'm screaming WHAT THE FUCK! I don't say the words. I'm not a monster. But, if he could hear inside my mind, he'd shudder. And then, quite possibly, get the fuck out, with our daughters in tow. Fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm thinking words that usually fall out of my sister's mouth. I'm not the cusser in the family; she is. But lately, her potty mouth language has been slipping right into my thoughts. I don't want to be a cusser. My parents wouldn't approve.\nJacob kisses me as my alarm sings Jack Johnson's Banana Pancakes. That song used to make me smile. I loved banana pancakes. But now I hate the song, and by association, I no longer love my favorite childhood breakfast. No offense, Mr. Johnson. I just really need more sleep. The worst part of all is now Jacob's morning kiss is connected in my brain with my alarm and the very long, exhausting day that lies ahead. I don't have the same thoughts on the weekends, but Monday through Friday mornings my internal reaction is the same. It's been going on for so long now. I can't remember when it started.\nI'm a full-time accountant and I've been doing three-quarters of the parenting for two years. Jacob started his own company, he says it's ours, and it sure the heck feels like it. It was his dream. I don't say it, but his dream took away my husband and what little me time I had. The proverbial cherry on top is I'm also our company's accountant.\nI'm thirty-nine; forty in a month. Still youngish, I guess. That's what people say, anyway. Nothing about me screams youngish though. Middleish maybe. The best way to describe my appearance is, well, messy. My two daughters? The same. Ava is seven. She's the oldest and has been charged with grooming herself and her five-year-old sister, Emi. Not the best mothering, I know. The sad truth is both of their ponytails look better than mine. Everybody agrees the girls and I are clones of each other. \\\"They look just like you, Emma. They're adorable. They have your hair. And your eyes.\\\" SHUT UP! That's what I scream \u2013 inside my mind. Civilized Emma smiles and says thank you. I don't want them to look like me. Not this me, anyway. Maybe the me I was when I was their age. That version of me was alright. My skin tone is okay, I guess. I get a little yellowish in the fall and winter, but during spring and summer it's a medium-brown tan, courtesy of all the girls' outdoor activities. My daughters are luckier than I. They've been blessed with beautiful brown skin year-round. A Mexican-American gift. Although, there are some ivory-skinned members of our family tree; complete with blond hair and blue eyes. The Spanish blood runs strong along those branches. Jacob's a white boy who tans, but it's more reddish than brownish. The only physical characteristic the four of us share is our dark hair. \nIt's a typical weekday morning. The girls are finishing breakfast, Jacob is already off to the site, and I'm running around like a cartoon character. An ill-dressed, ill-conceived, disheveled cartoon character.\u00a0 \n\\\"Finish up. Time to go.\\\" Always the same lines out of my mouth. You'd think they'd have it memorized by now. They do what they always do; leave the bowl on the table for their Fairy-dishwashing-Godmother to clean up when she gets home after a very long day. \\\"Keys. Need the keys. Where are the keys?\\\" I mutter to myself. \\\"Where are the keys?! Did one of you move them?\\\" I don't mutter this time.\n\n\\\"They're hanging on your purse, Mommy,\\\" Ava says. She heads to the couch to show me she knows exactly where they are. Please be there. She looks confident. Maybe she already saw them. As soon as she reaches my purse, we both know they're not where either of us hoped they'd be. She used her money to buy me a bedazzled MOM keychain which attaches to whichever bag I choose to use, not that I bother to change from one to another nowadays. There's disappointment in her eyes as she finds them missing. The gift hasn't worked. Apparently, it's a normal mom thing. We have so much on our plates and minds that losing the keys and our glasses and just about everything else is understandable from time to time. So, F it!\n\\\"Found 'em,\\\" Emi says as she holds them up. \n\\\"Way to go, Emi baby,\\\" I say as I take the keys and kiss her on the cheek. \n\\\"Did you sign--,\\\" Ava begins to speak.\n\\\"Our lunches, Mommy,\\\" Emi interrupts.\n\\\"Stop interrupting me, Emi!\\\" Ava's upset about the keys. I don't blame her.\n\\\"Ava, please remember to use your manners.\\\" \n\\\"But she interrupted me and she's not supposed to.\\\"\n\\\"Ava, you're the big sister so you have to teach her. It's a big job, I know. I've got a little sister, too.\\\"\n\\\"Sorry.\\\" \n\\\"It's okay,\\\" Emi replies in her sweet little voice.\n\\\"Try your hardest not to interrupt people, okay?\\\"\n\\\"Okay, Mommy.\\\"\n\\\"Did you sign my permission slip?\\\" Ava asks. Sadly, I think she already knows the answer.\nLunchables for three. Permission slip crumpled on bottom of purse, quick signature, and done! I hurry them out the door.\nCar rides to and from school were a mess, even with music. So, after a week of constant bickering over which songs to listen to, I did what I had to do, I said yes to headphones and tablets. School is close, but the five minutes of quiet each morning and each afternoon is a treat. I'm a silent driver. I don't turn on the radio, I don't listen to podcasts, I listen to absolute silence and it is beautiful. \nThere's always a car line at this time, but we always manage to make it. One gate open, one way in. The worst is when the kids stay in their car until they get to the very front of the line. You can get out before then. You're right next to the sidewalk. You're safe. I always have an urge to scream this out the window, but I don't. I'm not a crazy person. Some parents shout, a few even honk. Insane behavior. You're a role model! I want to scream this, too. But I don't. I would be so embarrassed for myself. And for my parents. They did not raise me to behave like a lunatic.\nAnd here we are. We made it with two minutes to spare. \\\"Go, go, go. Be great. Be kind. Love you.\\\" \n\\\"Love you, Mommy,\\\" they chorus and hustle out of the car and into their second lives.\u00a0 \nWho knows what goes on in there? Away from me. I wonder what they say about me on the playground. Is it kind? Is it the truth? What is the truth? Am I a loving mother? The doting, understanding kind? Or am I the mother who is always looking forward to the end of the night when all the voices are off and quiet fills the air? Time will tell. The truth is always revealed. Will they end up in therapy someday? Likely. Many people I know admit they're either in therapy, on some sort of medication, or involved in a combination of both. These days many are taking a puff on a vape to chill out and drift off to sleep. Seems like a slippery slope to me. But I like wine, so I'm careful with the judgment.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\nChapter 2\n\nYou know those TV showChapter 2s where co-workers eat lunch together, go to happy hour, and attend each other's family gatherings? That's not me. I eat lunch at my desk. I welcome the solitude. I'm noticing a pattern in my personality. Life is busy. It's a welcome change to sit by myself and do just about anything. I usually use the time to check off items on my To Do list. So, working lunches it is. Today, it's a Nacho Lunchable complete with a sugary drink and dessert.\n\n\n\n"}

I can't see him, but I can feel his presence; a heavy oppression that pins me in place. My eyes dart around the room, trying to take in any details that might help me in an attempt to distract my mind to stay calm.\nHe shifts in the dark and I turn on reflex. Or I try to. The panic I had tried so desperately to control courses through me as my body refuses to respond. My heartbeat thunders in my ears and I fight to think through the adrenaline. There is something I need to know. A question jumbled on my tongue. \nThe monitor disappears as he steps in front of it and a cold, terrifying clarity washes over me as his silhouette manifests.\nWho is he?\nI try to make out anything about him. Is he tall or short? Stocky or lean? Shadows dance across the room, playing tricks on my mind, but I am filled with an unbearable need to know. As if that knowledge would somehow save me.\n\\\"Please,\\\" I whisper, and then the world darkens as he looms over me. A gloved hand reaches out to caress my cheek. \n\\\"Who are you?\\\" I ask, terrified of the question. \nTerrified of the answer. \nMy heart jumps when he leans in and the lines of his face begin to solidify. My eyes water as I strain to see in the darkness, desperate to learn something. Anything. I can almost make out his face when I feel the silky-softness coil around my neck, tightening slowly, and animal instinct kicks in. I fight against my bonds, hands clawing at the air, body thrashing.\nThe dire need to breathe overrides the need to know. I can't stay focused on his face, can't quite comprehend the words I hear as a voice whispers to me from the darkness...\nI jolt awake in bed, frantically fighting the covers as panicked adrenaline courses through my veins. I gasp in air, my mind still reeling even as the burning feeling in my throat begins to subside. But by the time I am free of the sheets, reason has returned and whatever words I heard in the dark have fled. \nLike they do every time.\nThe cool night air washes over my body, slick with sweat, and I shiver as I get out of bed. I pad silently across the room to my window and rest my head against the wall, shifting my gaze to see beyond the reflection of brown hair and blue eyes staring back at me. I can't face the conviction in that look so instead I focus on my backyard and the thick forest that separates me from my neighbors. \nA forest and the thousand miles that separate me from the life I left behind.\nBut still the unanswered questions haunt me. Like a verbal manifestation of Laura's ghost, begging to be put to rest.\n\nChapter 2\n\n\\\"Come in, please,\\\" Dr. Morales says, holding the door open as she gestured me inside. I examine her out of the corner of my eye as I clutch my purse to my shoulder and lean forward to peer into her office. She is a short woman, probably in her late forties, with wavy, amber hair and a kind face. She waits patiently as I teeter on the edge of the threshold like a half feral cat. \nAccented with dark reds and browns, the room feels cozy. Sunlight filters in through large bay windows set behind a desk piled high with neatly organized paperwork, warming the room. Filled bookshelves broke up the moss covered walls, broken up by framed degrees and the occasional plant. \nMy eyes drift to a worn leather couch tucked against the wall to my left. Flanked by two side tables adorned with boxes of tissues and garnished with two faded throw pillows in each corner, the sofa seemed dauntingly large. Do people seriously lay down during their sessions? \nA smaller armchair is fixed across the room from the couch with its own side table hosting a manilla folder and a steaming mug. The room smells faintly of an incense that reminds me of home and I find myself taking a tentative step forward before I realize what I was doing. Somewhere in the back of my mind part of me screams to turn and run. That the nightmares would be better than the answers I might find here. \n I can't turn back now, I tell myself. If at the end of the session this isn't right for me, I can walk out and never look back. \nI owe it to myself to give this a shot. I hadn't gotten a decent night's sleep since, well... for a long while now.\nStill, it takes me a few more moments before I can convince my feet to move and take another tentative step into the room. I make my way to the leather couch and sit, purse clutched in my lap, body rigid. I can only imagine what Dr. Morales is already deducing from my body language. She closes the door behind me and sits down in the chair opposite me, taking up a small folder.\n\\\"Hi Lyra. It's nice to meet you in person,\\\" Dr. Morales says, smiling over at me. \\\"Before we begin, I'm required by law to tell you about patient-doctor privacy and your rights. Okay?\\\" I nod.\nI only half listen as my brain runs through how I'm going to approach this. The things I want to say. What she might ask me. \nAnd what I didn't want to talk about. \n\\\"Now, why are you coming in today?\\\" My mind slides back into the present and I stare at her for a minute, the words tangling on my tongue. \n\\\"Do you know who I am?\\\" I finally ask.\n\\\"I know your name is Lyra White.\\\"\nI glance out the bay windows as I consider my reply.\n\\\"Previously Elaine Thompson,\\\" is what I finally settle on.\n\\\"Ah. The Trial of the Century,\\\" she says with the embellished tone of a news caster. I nod at her statement.\n\\\"So, you do know who I am.\\\"\n\\\"I know your name is Lyra White,\\\" Dr. Morales repeats, her voice soft. \\\"And now I know that your name used to be Elaine Thompson and that you testified in the Midwest Strangler case. But I don't know you. Yet,\\\" she adds, flashing me a gentle smile.\nMy eyes flutter closed as something inside me loosens; a tightness I had grown so used to I didn't realize it was there. Maybe I had finally found someone I could talk to without judgement. God knows I probably deserved it, but I just wanted the chance to tell someone my side of the story. Even if only because it was her job to listen to people and their secrets.\n\n\n\n"}

The awkward silence was filled with occasional snorts and my own desperate throat clearing. Eventually, my host excused himself by pretending to go check on the crew and left me alone on the small observation deck of the cruiser.\nI am accustomed to space. I'm from a nomadic civilization of humans called the Andromeda Fleet. We are scientists; we study and catalog various intergalactic phenomena for private research organizations. Our employers include anyone wealthy enough to pay us, ranging from the New Republic, to private citizens, to even the First Order. If the profit is good, we stop at nothing to complete our missions. That day, however, I was assigned a different type of mission: real estate.\nMy family belongs to the diplomat caste\u2014in fact, my father is our ambassador to Coruscant. I've been trained my whole life for this type of work; I'm supposed to know what to say and when to say it. Keywords: supposed to.\nI raked my fingertips across my face, feeling the empty void in my stomach expand with each parsec we put between us and the fleet. My fleet. Even the thought of living on the surface of a planet made my head spin.\n\\\"Representative Caltrel, we will soon enter the planet's atmosphere.\\\" My host, Javvik, had returned with a friendly snort. I thanked him while I gathered my things\u2014canisters for air, water, and dirt samples as well as my datapad.\nA small team of Javvik's crew accompanied us as we departed the landing zone in a small freight speeder. The crew members, who hailed from various species across the galaxy (most of which I'd never seen in my life), held short-range blasters which made my nerves skyrocket. A lazy, warm breeze swept in some cloud cover as my host explained a few preliminaries about the planet. The sun-facing side of the planet enjoyed short, varied seasons while the opposite side lay in permanent, devastating winter. He explained that it would be necessary to live on this side of the planet\u2014for humans, that is.\nSoon enough, we reached the perfect spot for some vegetation samples. Trees were scattered around a large lake that seemed to have swallowed up part of the forest. It was breathtaking actually, even though the clouds made me feel slightly claustrophobic.\nI started an air analysis on my datapad while I gathered some other samples from around the lake. Javvik stood nearby impatiently, and I could tell that his clients usually weren't so thorough. His usual buyers were probably miners or businessmen, not home hunters.\nMy eye caught sight of the crew members when they began to stir and raise their weapons. Javvik shouted something in a language I assumed most of them knew, and the crew began to quiet. I continued my work.\nThen, a few minutes later, I felt the entire ground lurch from some kind of impact. I caught my balance and whipped my head toward Javvik, whose jaw had gone completely slack. Following his line of vision, I looked across the lake\u2014there was something rising from the murky water. My eyes narrowed. Is that...a\u00a0warhead?\nI heard the crackle of a loud voice over a speaker not a few seconds later. \\\"This is the First Order. You are not cleared for this area. Surrender yourselves immediately.\\\"\nI nearly tripped over myself in my mad dash towards Javvik. He was barking something else to his crew, who appeared equally panicked. \\\"W\u2014We have to go,\\\" I breathed, my lungs heaving.\n\\\"There's been a misunderstanding,\\\" Javvik rumbled, worry in his yellow eyes. He turned toward the origin of the announcement and shouted in a weak voice, \\\"I\u2014I\u2014I own the deed to this p\u2014planet!\\\"\nAnother order echoed from within the forest, closer this time. \\\"This is your second and final warning. Put down your weapons.\\\"\n\\\"Mr. Javvik.\\\" My knuckles were white on the strap of my shoulder bag. \\\"We have to go.\\\"\nHe looked conflicted and stubborn. I glanced around at the restless crew as they waited for their next cue.\nA blast of red shot out from the trees and struck a crew member who hadn't lowered his weapon. The alien squealed with pain and dropped his blaster, clutching his burnt arm. My heart leaped into my throat as I tore off in the direction of the speeder. I saw Javvik in my peripheral vision, hobbling after me.\nThe exchange of fire began almost immediately, filling the air with the sounds of high pitched discharges and scorching impacts. A tree ahead of me caught ablaze and I heard myself scream a curse. In what seemed like forever, I finally reached the speeder.\nNo sooner after I'd glanced at the complex controls that I had no ability to use, I felt a searing bolt of electricity hit my back. My body convulsed, teeth grinding, and then I dropped limply to the metal floor of the speeder. Directly in my line of vision, I saw Javvik on the ground, too\u2014his eyes were full of fear. I wanted to scream, cry, or maybe die. But I couldn't move.\nVoices drew near us, speaking through the static of respirators.\n\\\"These are the last, sir,\\\" said the first.\n\\\"Good job,\\\" the second voice said. I felt the floor dip to the side as two sets of white boots entered my line of vision. \\\"We have to take one of them for questioning.\\\"\n\\\"Which one?\\\"\nThere was a dry laugh. \\\"Isn't it obvious?\\\"\nI watched as the barrel of a blaster was placed against Javvik's head. If I had been able to, I would have screamed with all my might before I blacked out.\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe first thing that struck me as wrong was the darkness. I never woke up during the night cycle unless my sister was kicking me in the back, and she moved off our homeship years ago.\nI sat up with a jerk, reaching for sheets or pillows or anything. My leg found the edge of the bed quickly, and when my toes touched the cold floor, I froze.\nI don't know where I am.\nThe coldness traveled up my leg and up my spine until my whole body was covered in goosebumps. As my racing thoughts tried to make sense of the situation, the whole atmosphere seemed to change around me. The air smelt wrong, the temperature was a few degrees too low, and even the gravity felt different.\n\\\"This is the First Order. You are not cleared for this area.\\\"\nMemories of the attack started aligning themselves, painting a nightmarish scene in my brain. I felt cold, and it wasn't from the floor. My face seemed to be numb. I vaguely wondered if I was the only survivor.\nAfter a few minutes of mental debate, I stood on shaky legs in an attempt to find some light. I heard nothing\u2014no humming engines or droids buzzing down the hall. I sensed I was in a small space, but that was all I could make out. After a few steps, a light suddenly turned on which forced me to cover my eyes for a moment.\nIt appeared to be a compact fresher with motion-detecting lights. Looking into the mirror above the sink, I noticed the gray jumper right away and wondered where my clothes\u2014my samples, my datapad\u2014had been taken. I also noted the cot, oddly missing sheets and pillows, and a metal door with a small glass window.\nI sprang for the door, grappling with anything that resembled a knob or a lever to no avail. The square window was too high for me to see through, so I jumped to steal glimpses outside. A dark corridor, nothing else.\n\n\n\n"}

The minty slosh from her mouth fell into the porcelain basin and disappeared with a swoosh of water. She flicked the faucet handle, silencing the mini waterfall. She bared her teeth in the mirror and checked for any remnants of the oatmeal she ate that morning. She was fishing out an oat that was lodged between two of her teeth when she heard pounding on the bathroom door.\nA muffled voice yelled from the other side, \\\"You're gonna be late, dummy!\\\"\nMarisol pulled the oat out of her mouth and rinsed it down the sink. She opened the bathroom door, nearly hitting her roommate smack dab in the face.\n\\\"I'm not going to be late,\\\" Marisol said, \\\"I'm leaving now.\\\"\nHer roommate, Nevada, looked at her with an eyebrow raised. \\\"You have less than 20 minutes to walk there. I hope you like sprinting,\\\" they said.\nMarisol stuffed her phone in her pocket and grabbed her backpack from where it was resting on the couch, slinging one of the straps over her shoulder. \\\"I hate sprinting,\\\" she said, making her way to the front door. She picked up her skateboard which leaned next to the doorway. \\\"Good thing I don't have to.\\\"\nNevada shrugged. \\\"Have a good day at work.\\\"\nMarisol looked back at them. \\\"Bring out the recycling while I'm gone. I'm tired of seeing your energy drinks pile up.\\\"\n\\\"Wow, I almost forgot how grumpy you are in the mornings,\\\" they laughed.\nMarisol rolled her eyes and walked out the door. She rushed down the dirty concrete stairwell of her apartment building until she made it out into the morning sun and onto the streets of New York City. The streets in front of her apartment weren't too busy compared to the rest of the city and she was grateful.\nShe dropped her skateboard onto the sidewalk in front of her. The wheels landed with a clack on the dingy concrete. She put her left foot on the skateboard and with her right, kicked off the ground. \nMarisol soared through the streets of New York. All of the time she had spent on her skateboard as a kid came in handy as she wove between the weekday morning foot traffic. She usually walked, but she woke up late today, so skateboarding would have to do. Her board rumbled under her feet as it forced itself over the bumpy cement pathway. A blonde haired woman almost screamed as Marisol whizzed by. \nHer surroundings transitioned from older brick residential buildings to new, glassy skyscrapers. Office buildings. Marisol pushed off her skateboard once again. She was almost to her destination. If everything worked out well, she'd be there a couple minutes early. \nShe coasted for the final stretch of the ride. She was moving at a walker's pace by the time she got to the front of the office building. She picked up her skateboard from the sidewalk, tucked it under her arm, and walked inside.\nMarisol worked at Vouge, a New-York based international media company. Vouge headquarters was an impressive 40 stories of sleek glass in midtown Manhattan. The building itself didn't stand out much next to the office buildings around it, but the company's reputation made it memorable. Vouge\u2019s reach extended into many corners of the media world. They owned several T.V. channels and print lines. Marisol worked for their magazine, which was named after the company.\nMarisol was hired as an intern first, and then quickly hired to be a photographer's assistant after making an impression. Now, she was 19 and working at one of the biggest media companies in the world. Though she was young and inexperienced, she worked hard. The small plastic card in her hand was proof of that.\nMarisol scanned her card at the front desk, clocking in, and made her way to the elevator. She pressed the cool metal button and stepped into the box. Pressing on the button of her floor had become muscle memory after a couple of months. Within 30 seconds, Marisol was on the 36th floor of the building. A large hand practically yanked her out of the elevator. \\\"Marisol, you're late!\\\" \nShe looked up at the face of the man dragging her across the office building. It was the tanned, carefully groomed face of one of the lead photographers, Isaac. Marisol yanked her hand away.\nMarisol gestured to the clock. \\\"I'm a minute early,\\\" she said.\nIsaac turned to look at her, his gelled handlebar moustache glistening in the white light of the room, \\\"Whatever,\\\" he said, \\\"I need you, we have a cover shoot today.\\\"\nMarisol's eyes widened. \\\"You should have led with that!\\\" she said. She started running towards the photography area, Isaac close behind. \n\\\"I need you to help set up the lighting,\\\" Isaac gestured towards the photography screen. \\\"My new muse should be here in 30 minutes!\\\"\nMarisol walked to the photography storage closet and set her backpack and skateboard down in a dusty corner. She pushed her way through the tightly packed room until she found a light stand. She picked it up and brought it out to the photography studio. She pointed it towards the screen. From there, she fell into a rhythm, bringing equipment from the closet and setting it up. She flicked on the lights a couple times, making sure they were working. In less than 10 minutes, the room was shining in perfect studio lighting.\nIsaac came back around to look at her work. \\\"I know I was right to hire you,\\\" he said, \\\"Go move some of the sofas closer to the shooting area for our guests to rest.\\\"\nMarisol was off without a word. She enlisted the help of a couple of interns to move the couches from by the elevator to the photoshoot area. The sleek white couch was positioned under the air conditioning. Marisol grabbed a lint roller and removed any dust from the couch that she could. She only had a moment to breathe before Isaac yelled from across the room.\n\\\"Everybody, our star is on her way up!\\\" He walked to the elevator. \\\"Get into position!\\\"\nMarisol's position was by Isaac's side and she was there in seconds. She plastered a smile on her face as a loud ding rang in her ears and the star of the day stepped into the room. \nMarisol had no idea who the model was for the day, but when she saw the woman, she had to say that she could have guessed it. Standing in front of her and greeting Isaac was the popular young French actress Colette.\nColette got famous after she scored the lead role on the popular American teen series 'Zodiac Class' when she was only 17. Every teenager knew who Colette was. After she made her acting debut, she starred in several movies and quickly gained over 20 million followers on her instagram. Now, at 20 years old, Colette was what many young teenagers aspired to be.\nAfter Isaac finished complimenting their guest, he put his hand on Marisol's shoulder. He smiled at her. \\\"Can you show our beautiful Colette to the dressing room?\\\" He looked over at a woman who entered with Colette. \\\"I'm going to talk to her manager about the details.\\\"\n\\\"It would be my pleasure.\\\" Marisol smiled at Colette and gestured towards the left. Marisol began walking in that direction as Colette followed her.\nMarisol had seen tons of pictures of Colette, but seeing her up close was a different story. She had smooth, dark skin and carefully brushed dark hair that fell past her shoulders.She was also taller than Marisol expected, standing high above Marisol's 5'4 frame. It felt like a giraffe was looming behind her. \nShe stopped in front of a door and gestured to it. A small bronze plaque rested on the front, reading 'DRESSING ROOM.' Marisol stepped to the side and gestured towards the door. \\\"Here you go, ma'am,\\\" she said, \\\"Hair stylists and makeup artists should be waiting in there for you.\\\"\nColette looked down at her and smiled. \\\"You can just call me Colette, by the way,\\\" she said, \\\"There's no need for such formalities.\\\" Her french accent rang out clearly in the hallway.\nIn another situation, Marisol might be flattered by a smile from such a gorgeous woman with such a cute accent. However, she was at work, and the woman in front of her was an internationally known celebrity. Marisol flashed her signature professional smile to the model in front of her. \\\"Okay, Colette. Is there anything I can help you with before I go back to the studio?\\\"\nColette shook her head and opened the door. \\\"No, thank you for your hospitality...\\\" Colette stared at Marisol, searching her face.\n\\\"Marisol,\\\" she said, \\\"My name is Marisol.\\\"\n\\\"Ah!\\\" Colette smiled once again. \\\"Thank you for your hospitality, Marisol.\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

I'm fourteen and shouldn't have glow-in-the-dark stickers on my ceiling.\nI'm not sure if I slept at all last night. My mind feels like mush. My eyes burn with the endless hours of staring. Repeating last night over and over and over again. The actions replaying like a movie stuck on a constant loop. Never-ending. \nI try to convince myself that last night was\u00a0 just a bad dream\u2014a horrific dream, that as soon as I go out of my room and greet my parents for breakfast, I will laugh and realize that everything is just how it has always been. That nothing has changed.\nBut, as I shift in the bed, my thighs throb with a soreness I've never experienced before. And, as I swallow, my throat is raw. A horrible sore throat. And it isn't just my throat; my entire jaw feels like I got punched in the face. It's achy, just like my entire body. \nSqueezing my eyes shut, tears leak out of them as I repeat in my head, just a dream. Just a dream. Just a dream. Not real. Not real. Nothing bad has ever happened to me and last night couldn't have been real.\nYet, with my eyes closed, the memories of last night are even more vivid. His haunting eyes. His devilish grin that I once thought was so cute. His hands. Bones rubbing. Choking. Gagging. His voice. On. Constant. Repeat.\nJerking my eyes back open, I force my arms to move, arms that feel bruised. Arms that don't feel like mine anymore. I pull my covers back, exposing my legs. Bruises mark my inner thighs, proving to me that last night did in fact happen. It was not a dream. It was real and it happened to me. A sob escapes my mouth as I toss my legs over the side of the bed and stare down at the bruises on my wrists.\nBones rubbing.\nI take a deep breath. Maybe I'm overreacting. So many girls have already been having sex in my grade. Plus, it's my fault. I drank. I led him on. I initiated everything. It's my own damn fault what happened.\nI stare at my purple, bruised skin in disbelief, the marks leaving a reminder of everything that happened. Reminding me of where his hands were and how it felt. His body crushing mine, restricting me from catching a breath. My lungs feeling like they were collapsing.\nWhat happens now? What do I do now? Pretend everything is okay\u2014that I'm okay?\nMy wobbly legs press down onto the newly carpeted floor, leaving an indent, as I carefully stand up. Every part of my body hurts\u2014parts I didn't even know could hurt. I'm suddenly aware of every inch of me. All my senses are heightened as my bones crack and my body throbs. I feel lost, confused, hurt, and used. I feel disgusting.\nFeeling exposed, and not wanting to see my discolored skin any longer, I shuffle towards my drawers and pull out my winter pajamas, making sure to cover every inch of me so I don't have to stare at myself any longer. So the bruises will disappear from sight,\u00a0 the evidence of what happened.\nIt was supposed to be just a normal day. Like any other day. Now, I feel like I don't know anything.\nA knock at my door. Then another. It makes me jump and I stare at my door, unable to speak. \n\\\"India, breakfast is ready. Come out.\\\"\n I just stare blankly at my door. I don't want to face my parents. I don't want them to see the changes in me that seem to have happened overnight. Moving back over to my bed, I climb under the covers, not wanting to face the day, or life for that matter. I want to lay here until all of this goes away.\n\u00a0 Closing my eyes, I doze back off, until I hear more knocks on my door. \n\\\"Indy, breakfast is cold now. I told you to come down.\\\" \nI hear her open the door, and I peek an eye open to see her move towards me. \n\\\"Are you okay?\\\" she asks softly and sits down on the bed next to me.\n Does she notice? Does she see the difference? Does she know what Caleb Anderson did to me? \n\\\"I just\u2014I\u2014\\\" I can't form a sentence. The words stick in my mouth. I feel like I'm going to throw up.\nMy mom gives me a sympathetic smile. \\\"Honey, I know last night was bad. Your dad and I were just so shocked when we saw the message Caleb sent you. You're still very young and we didn't expect you to be involved with boys yet, but I've talked to your father and have calmed him down.\\\" She kisses my forehead gently, and I now see what she meant. She has it all wrong. She thinks I wanted to have sex with Caleb. She doesn't know. \\\"We know you're in high school now and you're figuring out who you are. Obviously, teenagers are going to drink and do normal teenage stuff. I'm glad that you called me to pick you up after you had been drinking, but if you think you are ready to have sex, then we need to have a serious talk because\u2014\\\"\nI shake my head fiercely. \\\"I'm not ready to have sex.

I feel tears flooding towards my eyes again and I force them back.\n\\\"Okay, well, I guess that's good. Still, regardless, whenever you do feel like you're ready, I want you to know you can talk to me.\\\" She looks over my pajamas and frowns. \\\"Why do you have your Christmas pajamas on? It's hot.\\\"\n\\\"I'm cold,\\\" I mumble and pull at the ends of my sleeves, making sure the bruises don't show.\nShe gives me a weird look before standing back up. \\\"You're crazy,\\\" she laughs with a wave of her hand. \\\"Hurry and get up, lazybones. Dad made pancakes.\\\"\n She stands there, obviously not going to leave until I succumb to the unappetizing calling of pancakes. Slumping out of bed, I trudge behind her out of my room and down the stairs to the kitchen, where my dad is sipping on his coffee with his feet perched on the hassock as he watches the news.\nA simple, regular morning. The smell of the pancakes hits my nose and it makes me feel sick. I feel the color drain from my face and my mouth pools with saliva. The thought of even attempting to eat right now makes\u00a0 slither up my throat. My dad doesn't even glance up at me, signaling that he is still furious about last night, despite my mother telling me otherwise.\n The sun streams down into our house through all the large, opened windows. Birds chirp outside like it's a beautiful, casual Saturday morning. The dishwasher rotates with the swish, swish of water. The news reporter discusses the latest going on in Pismo Beach, California today. Nothing has changed. Yet, somehow, I'm completely different and nobody notices. The world doesn't stop for me. Everyone is going about their lives as if my virginity wasn't stolen from me violently just hours before.\nMy body floats over to the pancakes. I stack two on before bringing it over to the table, where I put a small amount of syrup on. Mindlessly, I stab at them, hoping my mom doesn't notice me not eating.

Underneath the canopy of skyscrapers, the uninterrupted hum of the city dims enough to reveal the songs of the jungle that encircles its concrete cousin. A bearded man slips inside one of the many vine-draped structures. Each magnificent building sprouts from the asphalt into the sky. Normally he is one to delight in the wild sounds of night. Tonight, his careful steps and racing heartbeat suggest that there are other, more pressing things for him to focus his ears.\nHis ink-stained hands guide open a door, revealing the silent unlit apartment inside. The man slinks inside, closing and locking the door as if it's made of brittle glass. Once it clicks shut, he presses his thumb over the cold metal surface of the doorknob for a half-second. Little red lights dance clockwise around it as the electronic lock engages.\nDim light builds across the room as the apartment's autonomous lights come to life. He waves his hands in the air with frantic urgency, whisper-shouting for them to turn off. Once again in darkness, he strides across the room. He pays little mind to the layers of dust lining the supple leather sofa as he slinks past. His feet wade through sheets of paper strewn over the hardwood floor which have tumbled from overflowing piles on the kitchen table. \nStanding next to a window, he pulls back a slender opening in its drawn curtain and peers out at the dark street below. His eyes dart side to side past the lush green vines that wrap the exterior of the building. He pushes the window covering back into place, releasing a thankful sigh that his pounding heart is the only thing he can hear. That is, aside from the steady hum of delivery drones outside that he'd long since learned to tune out. \nTurning back toward a large walk-in closet, he slides openits doors with delicate care. He pulls a small can of black spray paint from his back pocketand places it on the top shelf in a box underneath folded clothes. His pulse slows as he breathes deep, and he returns to the kitchen. Dropping to his knees, he collects the loose papers on the floor, his head darting toward the door every few seconds. Sweat glistens on the glassy smooth skin of his forehead like a cold drink on a hot day.\nAfter stuffing the rest of the papers inside the same box he left the spray paint, he closes it tight. On the balls of his feet, he slides to the back of the closet. He runs his hand left to right along a line of nearly identical jackets, counting in his head until he reaches fourteen. \nHe reaches into the far hip pocket of the garment, pulling out a small physical hard drive like he's handling a newborn. The drive is peppered with crude solder points and mismatching components as if it had been assembled ad-hoc from spare parts. Pocketing the drive, he returns to the front door and rests his ear against it for a few seconds. \nHe takes a deep breath and cracks the door open, peering outside. Confirming the coast is clear, he darts down the empty hallway, swivelling his head every few seconds to check behind him while he makes his way to the street. Without a moment wasted, he flags the first vehicle passing by. He hops inside its driverless cabin, slouching his head below its windows.\n\\\"South launchpad,\\\" the bearded man says like he's sharing a secret, and the vehicle hums into motion. \nWith each passing minute his actions become more frantic. He alternates between slow meditative breaths with his eyes closed, to shuffling from seat to seat, peering out the windows. All the while, his hand remains firmly in his pocket, clutching the jury-rigged hard drive until he arrives at his destination.\nBefore stepping out of the car, he looks out in each direction. He's repeated this so many times it might as well be ritual. He allows himself a nervous smile as he exits to the empty street, skipping across toward a massive warehouse. When he's almost on the sidewalk, every muscle in his body freezes solid as if it's an involuntary reflex. With his neck frozen still, his pupils make their way toward the rightmost edge of his eyelids. They shrink to pinholes as they lock on to the bright white light of an approaching vehicle.\n\nLights embedded in the street surface under his feet illuminate a vibrant red color, creating a circle around him as the vehicle gets closer. His heart drops to his hips before he closes his eyes. He takes a deep breath and turns toward the approaching headlights, retracting his hands from his pockets and raising them both in the air. \nWith his eyes still closed, he almost falls off his feet when a light gust of air washes over him. The vehicle has gently turned to drive past him, speeding away. Several seconds pass before he's able to swallow the lump in his throat and coax his muscles into stepping onto the sidewalk. He proceeds into the warehouse building, the street empty once again.\nThe clerk sitting at a small desk across the sparse lobby jumps in his seat, as if startled by the metallic snap of the door clicking open. The bearded man walks closer to him, where it's clear that the clerk is actually semi-translucent. It's a product of holographic projectors arranged behind the desk. He shares a smile with the clerk like they know each other well.\n\\\"Hello sir,\\\" the holographic clerk says in a curious tone, raising an eyebrow as the man walks to his desk. \\\"You're not scheduled for any flights this evening...\\\" \n\\\"I know, I know,\\\" the bearded man replies, his voice sounding unnatural, as if reading from a script. \\\"Here's the thing... I was just sitting at home and I realized, I completely forgot to inspect one of the satellites I was supposed to hit on my rounds yesterday. So...\\\" he continues, gearing himself up to ask, \\\"Do you think I could take my shuttle up for a bit, maybe off the books? I'm already on thin ice with the company, so I'd rather nip this in the bud if I can, you know?\\\"\nThe clerk looks back at him, furrowing his simulated brow as if that's the only thing he could have done in response. \\\"Sir, you know any official maintenance flights need approval from the company first. I'm very sorry.\\\"\n\\\"Yeah, I know,\\\" the man says, an abrupt response like he's prepared to say it. \\\"Okay, how about this... I don't think I've used any of my fuel creds this year. What if we called it a rec flight? There's like a ninety percent chance I won't even have to touch the satellite, I just have to give it a quick one-two.\\\"\n\\\"I... suppose I can arrange this,\\\" the clerk responds. \\\"As long as you don't touch anything, it indeed is technically a recreational flight. But, if you do notice any required maintenance you must return and go through the proper channels.\\\"\n\\\"Deal!\\\" the bearded man says while cracking a smile his eyes can't match. He hops back and over to the elevator at the side of the small room. \\\"I owe you one.\\\" \n\\\"There's nothing you can offer that I may need,\\\" the clerk says matter-of-factly, sounding neither pleased nor annoyed. The elevator doors slide shut. \nDespite having ridden this elevator many times, the bearded man is convinced it's ten stories taller this time around. Each creak or rattle adds a new grey hair to his bushy beard, which he strokes and picks at restlessly until the doors slide open. \nHe leaps off the elevator as if it's about to plummet behind him, scampering onto the building's roof, which is a massive open-air shuttle dock. His unkempt hair blows over his face as he approaches the small craft in the middle, its engines already powered up. The shuttle door whirs open, beckoning him inside its comfortable, yet utilitarian cabin. \n\\\"Good evening, Captain,\\\" a soft voice plays over dash mounted speakers. \\\"Where are we going today?\\\" \n\\\"How many times have I told you not to call me that,\\\" the man says blankly. \\\"Anyways, I'll take the reins on this one, it's a bit of a custom trip.\\\" \n\\\"Very well, I'm here if you need me,\\\" the voice says before the cabin goes silent. \nThe man's hands move about the cabin as if they have minds of their own, turning dials, pressing buttons, and flipping switches in preparation to take off. The ship shudders when he eases his foot on a pedal beneath the dash. As the craft begins to lift off the ground, he pulls back on the wheel in front of him. The blood rushes to his head as the cabin orients vertically, facing the sky. He presses his foot to the floor so hard it hurts.\n\n\n\n"}

Hardware, plates, pans, spare parts and different items that were once housed in the crushed buildings lay in a muddy mess on the path the heavy machines trailed. Tire marks mar the red soil still wet from last night's rain, leaving the messenger of doom temporal imprints as it carries on its frenzy of destruction.\nDistant cries of horror follow the sound of falling building, tears flow with muffled cries as the rampage continues, destroying the source of livelihood for some of the men and women scampering to salvage a few items. Feet belonging to men and women of different builds carry them to safety, away from where they once made money. Curses fly in the air, mostly directed to the driver behind the wheels of the bulldozer, the governor who gave the order for the demolition and people who supported it.\nMama Tee's back screams in protest as she bends to pick another set of stainless plates to dump into the big bag, popularly referred to as Ghana-must-go sitting in the middle of her dim-lit shop.

Her eyes roam the shelves accommodating the various cookware set still in their boxes of purchase, she places a hand on her chest, right above the corner of her shirt where the words: Adieu Mama had been stitched with black thread and her lips move faster.\nResignation hangs in the air as her back hits the unpainted walls, her gaze wanders to the front of her shop, lingering on the usual swirl patterns her broom creates whenever she sweeps. The whirring of the machine fades as thoughts of impending doom take over, she takes tentative steps towards the entrance and a low yelp escapes her at the contact of her big toe against the bag.\nRattled by the sound of the pans and pots in the bag, she forgets her pain and as if in a trance, she resumes packing without the former care. Zipping the bag with a smile concealing her inner turmoil, her chest deflates, sweat trickles from her face to create dots on her shirt as she drags the bag along the carpeted floor to place it beside the smaller ones by the aluminium door.\nInstead of leaving to save more items, she waits behind, hands holding her breasts with her eyes fixated in a certain direction, barely processing the destruction going on around her. Her foot drums into the carpet, her sole connects directly with the ground through the holes of her Dunlop slippers. A child runs past her shop, her neck stretches in his direction as her eyes narrow and her shoulders sag when she identifies the boy's shirt punctured with baby fist sized holes. \nA young lad bursts into her shop, she lets out a sigh, her hand coming to rest on his back as he bends at the waist to catch his breath. \\\"Mama,\\\" he raises his head, his mouth hangs open, \\\"soldiers are coming.\\\"\nMama Tee's eyes widen in fear, more lines appear on her sweaty forehead, masking the thin horizontal scar. She shudders at the implication of her son's words, yanks the satin scarf off her head and the tiny braids that have seen better days cascade down her back. Putting the braids into a loose bun, her scarf acts as a ribbon to keep them away from her face and her lips move.\n\\\"Can you carry this one?\\\" His eyes follow the direction of her index finger, he lifts one of the bags and nods. \\\"Ngwanu, carry it.\\\"\nScurrying to the small box under her table, she wrenches it open to retrieve crumpled naira notes she tucks into her bra. She casts one look at her shop, a tear which she is quick to swipe at trails down her cheek.\nJoining her sixteen-year-old son at the door, a fake smile creeps up to her cracked lips when she sees him with the biggest bag on his head and her head bobs. He flashes her a reassuring smile, his lips part to reveal a side gap tooth, similar to that of his mother. His hand moves to the waistband of his short held together by cable wires, he folds it once more, walks out of the shop before sparing his mother a backward glance.\n\\\"I'm coming.\\\" Taking a step out of the door, the bag in her hand drops to the floor when her eyes land on the third bag. \\\"Where is your brother?\\\" He spins to face her, the bag on his head almost falling. \\\"Where's Tobe?\\\"\n\\\"Tobe? He should be here...\\\" the boy trails off, his eyes scan the damage as if his brother will mysteriously appear in front of him. \\\"He came back. I told him to call you.\\\"\nGunshots pierce the unusual silence, they both jump. Fear flashes across his big eyes, tinges his voice when he says, \\\"Mama.\\\"\nMama Tee's heart hammers as her eyes dart in the direction the shot is loudest. Her lips quiver, she shakes her head, refusing to harken to the plea in her son's eyes.\n\\\"Ngwanu,\\\" she stalks to him, heart in her mouth as she rids him of the bag still on his head, \\\"where's your younger brother?\\\" Dread seeps into her voice, her eyes gloss with unshed tears. \\\"Where's Tobenna?\\\"\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe theme song of the broadcasting station, NTA rents the quietude after Sullivan taps on a button on the black remote.

Every step, heavier than the last. And those damn grey stairs, those fucking destroyers of quads, they elongated \u2014 taunting me. \nIt was a moment of insanity, moving into a 5th-floor apartment. A crime against humanity fabricated by city life, to climb Mount Olympus after hours of work just for a fraction of relief. \nAfter a bone-crushing day, sleep would be my consolation prize. I would turn a blind eye to the dishes that undoubtedly piled up in the sink, the clothes that littered the ground, and the microwave fresh dinner. More accurately, I won't reprimand my brothers; not out of great benevolence, but pure exhaustion. Today, I'll drop the weight of the responsibility of managing not only my own life but also theirs \u2014 to be forgotten at my bedroom door. \nToday, I'll bask in the emptiness of sleep and momentarily let dreams erase my reality.\nI halted in my crusade towards sleep. \nA barricade of brown boxes towered in the narrow staircase, block the last flight of steps to my salvation. Rude! I stared, eyebrows furrowed and eyes slit tight. A sad attempt at moving them out of the way. Cruel that I couldn't Carrie my way out of this. What did a girl have to do to get some telekinesis powers, bathe in blood?\n\\\"Hey, there, neighbor,\\\" echoed a cheerful, husky voice, dribbling down the stairs.\nMy eyes searched for the source, following the white walls up... Oh, my sweet abs Jesus.\nThere, leaning on the wooden stair rails without a care in the world, was one of the most handsome men I've seen in a long while.\nI needed to go out and smell the roses more often. Such fine specimens prowled in the wild, and all I saw between the four grey walls of my office were receding hairlines and dad bods. \nBut, what was the point of venturing into the world when all I could do was stare? \nIf not for my quest to drop dead into bed, I would have admired how handsome he was; how his dark, soft curls, damp with sweat, clung to the sides of his chiseled face, or how his white tank top did nothing to cover up his well-toned body. Maybe, just maybe, I would have traced the line of his abs until it disappeared into his low-hanging sweatpants and let my mind conjure up an image of what lay underneath that impressive \u2014 \nI plowed a bulldozer over that train of thought. My cheeks burned hot as I patted them once and asked,\\\"Are these boxes yours?\\\"\nThe question struck unnecessarily bitchy. Then again, this sex on legs was the culprit obstructing my sleep, so he deserved a little bite. \n\\\"Yeah, sorry about that.\\\" The tall stranger rubbed the back of his neck, ruffling his black curls. His eyes wavered between the stacked boxes and the open green door behind him. A ominous cloud loomed over him as his tired eyes counted the endless stack. \\\"I'll move them right away.\\\"\nHe tugged his white shirt up and wiped the sweat off his angular jaw. The inevitable result \u2014 a full view of his sculpted abs, tinted pink from all the lifting. He huffed and picked one of the boxes from the floor. One by one, he placed them against the railings. \n\\\"My lady.\\\" He held out his hand, pointing to the tiny sliver of space between the wall and the tower of cardboard. \nI didn't have the will to tell him that I would have to lose half of my butt-cheeks to fit through that narrow space. \\\"Thank you, my lord,\\\" I said, playing along.\n\nI scooted, pressed tightly against the wall, past the cardboard avalanche of doom. I sighed in relief when I reached the top. Tragedy avoided. \nI turned to my new neighbor.\nI was accustomed to dwelling with tall people, as the tall gene had engraved itself into my family's genealogy. Well, I was the exception. That thing got one look at me and took a hard pass on my genetic code. So, as an average-height girl, I was not easily intimidated by the giants that lived with me.However, standing there under the intense stare of his dark-green eyes sent every nerve in my body into overdrive.\n\\\"My name's Noah,\\\" he said in a husky tone. \\\"I hope my poor choice of where to put my boxes doesn't make you think I'll be a bad neighbor.\\\" He offered his right hand. \nMy hand intertwined with his larger one. \\\"Name's Riley, and I hope my sassiness doesn't make you think I'll be a bad neighbor. It's just... been a long day.\\\"\n\\\"All is forgiven,\\\" he said swiftly, as a gentle smile graced his face. \nI locked eyes with him, and it was like I fell into a painting. They were the epitome of a brightly lit forest\u2014 full of life and color. But not blinding. It made me wish to lay down in a meadow and take a nap under the blue sky. \nNoah's lips twitched into a smirk like he read the thoughts strolling through my mind. His cheek creases deepened as a dimple appeared and his thumb brushed against our interlocked hands.\nMy cheeks reddened. Heat spread down my neck and past my chest, pooling in my stomach. I looked like a ripe tomato, but Noah did not mind. He gleamed with joy, happy to have his ego stroked. \nTrying not to make it more awkward, I pulled away and took a small step back. The space helped calm my flustered heart as silence overtook the distance between us. His green eyes locked on me, waiting for my next move. \nSurely, I should bid farewell and good riddance. My apartment was right there, and just a few feet away to the right, somewhere in that cheap New York apartment, was a bed waiting to embrace me. \nThe strain on Noah's forehead stopped me. \\\"Hey, Noah, do you need help carrying the rest of those boxes?\\\" I asked. \nLet it be written into the record that I was not flirting. \nI was acting neighborly \u2014 a good person like my parents taught me. They would be disappointed otherwise. Absolutely. I was one thousand percent, irrefutable, doing this out of the goodness of my heart.\n\\\"I don't want to inconvenience you, and some of these are quite heavy,\\\" he answered. His chest puffed like a lion roaring from a high cliff. \nI never understood why men felt the need to show off their strength.\nMy theory: remnants of the caveman mentality that once ruled male psychology. However, looking at him now, shoulders squared, a cocky smile on his face, and that alluring and teasing gaze... \nWell, I almost found it endearing.\n\\\"I can handle a lot more than you think I can,\\\" I said. \nNoah's right eyebrow merged with his hairline at my tone. \nUggh. I mentally slapped myselffor how it sounded out of context. \\\"I meant like, strength-wise. You know,\\\" \u2014 I am dying \u2014 \\\"like, I can handle your heavy boxes.\\\" \nNoah's smile widened. My fingers itched to pinch his cheek and wipe that smirk off his handsome face.\n\\\"My lady,\\\" \u2014 the word lingered in his tongue as he leaned in closer \u2014 \\\"if you think so, who am I to deny you.\\\" His tone trod a line between flirting and teasing.\n\nI bit my tongue, resisting the need to find out which one.\nI walked down the stairs to the closest box and holstered it in my arms. My fingers clamped around the edges. FUCK, this is heavy. My arms stretched as far as I could reach, barely able to encompass the container. With every step I took, it slipped just a little bit. \n\\\"WAIT! Not that one!!!\\\" Noah screamed.\nMy heart skipped a beat, and I lost track of my feet. \nGravity yanked on my back. My fingers clenched at the box, nails puncturing the cardboard. Everything else happened in a blur. One minute I was plummeting. The next, Noah's arms seized my waist, pressing me tight against his broad chest.\nNoah stared in horror. His face flinched, contorting in pain.The sound of metal and broken glass permeated through the air, wrecking into him, wave after shattering wave.\n\\\"No, no, noooo!'' Noah screamed. His green eyes looked around aimlessly, wide open,like magically, a fairy would appear and reverse time. \nThe box remained, tattered and crushed amid a sea of spilled books, wires, clothes, and bent cardboard.\n\n\n\n"}

She doesn't bother to look back at me, leaving me to stare at the tightly wound grey bun on the back of her head. Her gnarled hands leisurely move as she organizes the stacks of old hymnals onto the bookshelf in the corner of the pastor's office. \nThe bell tower. I'd worked at the Duke University Chapel for going on two years now, and I'd somehow avoided taking the hundreds of creaky, winding stairs to the uppermost level of the church. There are several reasons I don't want to venture up there\u2014the sheer number of stairs, all the dust that would surely stir up my seasonal allergies, the pitch darkness except for the places where the moon shines in, but most of all...the bats. No creature on this planet gives me the creeps more than those little flying monsters. \n\\\"But...why?\\\" I ask in a small voice. \nShe looks at me over her shoulder, her gaze sharp over the rim of her bifocals. \\\"I need you to go up there and get the rest of the hymnals. The elders have asked that we get them all out of storage and display them properly; most of them are antiques. There are only about fifteen; you'll be able to carry them all,\\\" she says, and I can tell by the tone of her voice that she's spoken her final word on the subject; I will be making my first trip to the bell tower, and I'll be making it right now. \nI sigh and grip my broom tightly, propping it over my shoulder like a weapon. I wish more than anything I could just do my usual chores in the sanctuary. It feels safer under its high arched ceilings, rows of mahogany pews, and stained-glass windows. Taking a deep breath, I walk to the old wooden door, ease it open, and slip into the darkness. \n\\\"Ugh,\\\" I mutter, pulling my phone out of my pocket and shining the light in my path. It helps just enough so I don't trip over my own feet as I ascend the staircase. \nRustling comes from above my head and I jerk my chin up, thrusting the broom into the air, peering through the darkness but seeing nothing.\nMy phone suddenly dings, startling me so much that I nearly drop it as I look down at the screen. I roll my eyes and delete the text. \\\"Get a clue, dude,\\\" I mumble to myself as I keep climbing. \nThe closer I get to the top of the tower, the warmer it gets, and sweat starts to bead at my hairline. August in North Carolina is sweltering, and it feels like it's at least 85 degrees in this non-ventilated bell tower. Finally, I scale the top step and skim the wall for a light switch. It flips with a snap, and the electricity running through the exposed wire makes an audible hum as it powers the single lightbulb. I scan the area until my gaze lands on the small alcove in the corner where Ms. Fairchild said I'd find the books. \nI bend over at the waist to fit into the small space and pull the hymnals from the shelf at the back of the alcove. I blindly grope the floor for the fifteenth hymnal, and my fingers brush against a cold slim chain. My eyebrow drops and I close my fist around it, drawing it out. I climb out of the alcove, knocking my head on the doorway as I stand.\n\\\"Ouch!\\\" I exclaim, pressing my palm to the top of my head, but the moonlight catches the intricate pendant in my hand, distracting me from my pain. \nThe disk practically covers the entirety of my palm. Silver and gold weave in and out of each other creating a pattern that is unlike anything I've ever seen. Through the delicate spaces a dark blue gem glints in the background. I bob my hand up and down measuring the weight of the piece\u2014it's heavy and definitely not a piece of costume jewelry. \n\\\"How did you get up here?\\\" I ask the object, brushing my fingertips over the design. A tiny hinge on the side catches my attention, and I hold the pendant up to the dim light; it's a locket.\u00a0 \nI hesitate with my thumb on the clasp; it feels like an invasion of privacy to open it. This belonged to someone, and I'm taking it upon myself to peek at what they have hidden inside. But the locket is too beautiful and the secrets it protects too tempting. I hold my breath and pry the two sides apart. I expect to find two pictures inside or a lock of hair, but what I'm met with is a brilliant light.\nThe locket falls from my hands, and I hurry backward, tripping over a box. I land on my butt, my eyes wide and mouth agape as the blinding beam fills the dark bell tower. The light falters like something is moving through it and a thud resounds in the musty space. And just like that, everything returns to normal. The light is gone and the locket lays on the ground...closed. \nMy gaze darts back to where the beam was\u2014the place where a figure lies on his back. He stares up at the rafters with unblinking eyes, his strong jaw flexing and the nostrils of his Romanesque nose flaring. He wears a long brown suit jacket, matching slacks, and flat square bowtie, appearing as if he just stepped out of a Jane Austen book. Slowly, he turns his head in my direction. A chestnut curl falls over his amethyst colored eyes, and he smiles. \n\nChapter 2 \n\nI cannot help but grin; in all my centuries within the human dimension, they still fascinate me. They live so blissfully ignorant of all the beings which exist parallel to them, and the moment they're exposed to the truth, they panic. \nCase in point: the creature seated on the ground across from me. She trembles so violently that the coils of copper hair knotted on the top of her head shake. Her green eyes are wide and unwavering, locked on me and her pink lips agape. Her porcelain skin drains of color, causing the sprinkling of freckles on her face and chest to appear dark gold. Her clothing is odd\u2014extremely short trousers, a shirt without buttons, and strange checkered shoes. This is the creature who summoned me.\nI stand, brushing the dust from my suit, and she scurries back, hitting the wall and stretches for the broom handle just out of her reach. \nI assess her appearance once more, trying to pinpoint which human people she hails from. \\\"Hal\u00f2, a bhean,\\\" I say in Gaelic, but she doesn't respond. \n\\\"Bonjour mademoiselle.\\\"\n\\\"Hallo, meine Dame.\\\"\n\\\"Salve, mi domina.\\\"\n\\\"Geia sas, kyr\u00eda mou.\\\"\n\\\"Kon'nichiwa, watashi no josei.\\\"\nNothing. \nI run my fingers over the back of my neck and watch her as I pace back and forth. She makes no attempt to move, abandoning the broom and holding her breath. \\\"Bloody hell, this is going to be impossible if you are mute,\\\" I say, reverting to the last language I spoke to a human.\n\\\"I'm not\u2014I'm not mute,\\\" she stammers, standing up on shaking legs and putting her hands on her hips. \\\"I'm really just confused as to why a guy dressed in clothes from the olden days has fallen from out of nowhere.\\\" \nMy lips curl at the sides and I cock an eyebrow. \\\"Simply put\u2014you summoned me.\\\"\n\\\"I summoned you? What are you talking about?\\\" She snatches the broom from the floor and holds it out at me, backing toward the staircase. \\\"Look, don't come any closer. What is it you want? If I have it, I'll give it to you. Just don't hurt me, okay?\\\" \nThe fear in her eyes makes my chest ache. Why must humans be so fearful at the start? I slide my hands into my pockets and maintain the distance she has put between us. Once she comprehends my purpose, she will relax. \\\"I wish nothing of you, my lady.\\\" I place my hand on the broom's bristles and guide it to the floor. \\\"In fact, I am here to give you what you want...anything you want.\\\" \nShe shakes her head once and backs up further, her back pressing against the wall behind her. \\\"What? I don't\u2014I don't want anything,\\\" she insists, her eyes darting around the small room, seemingly trying to find the quickest way to escape. \n\\\"But you are to be my mistress, and I your loyal servant. I only wish to please you.\\\"\nHer eyes widen further, and her expression turns from bewildered to terrified. \\\"Mistress?\\\" she squeaks as she sidles along the wall toward the door. \\\"Seriously, dude, I will call the police in a heartbeat. I mean it; don't touch me,\\\" she hisses as she scrambles down the spiraling staircase, sparing me a glance over her shoulder as she runs. \nI glance around the room and spot my locket lying on the floor next to a neat stack of books, and I gather them both. Racing after her, I pull the silver chain over my head and tuck the pendant inside my shirt. \\\"Please, my lady, you forgot your books.\\\" \nShe turns around, her eyes wild with terror and disbelief. She looks from my face to the books, and she yanks them from my hands, practically tosses them onto a table against the wall, then without a look back, runs down the hall away from me.\n\n\n\n"}

She is about to attack another ship and pillage it.\n\n#pirate, #action, #adventure, #fantasy, #fiction, #epic, #sea\n\nA Pirate's Tale\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n \nThe floor lurched beneath Isla, but her footing remained steady. The rocking of the ship was like the beating of her heart. Beneath her, the dark wood was worn smooth from time and the harshest weather. Overhead the black sails were taut, eating the wind that collided against the canvas. In the darkness of the early morning, the ship looked like nothing more than a silhouette. It sliced through the water, like a shadow gliding over the land. \nIsla cut her gaze away from the horizon and to the storm that lay within the ship's rigging. The crew flew about, putting her commands into action. Around her, the four corners of the kingdom had been pulled together. \nThe sky was lightening, pieces of the sun breaking the horizon behind them. Isla looked skyward, catching the last light of the fading stars. In their final farewell, she read the direction that she already sensed in the dip, bend, and tug of the water. \nThere was a feeling of peace and danger that lay at her feet. The ocean was a living creature that took what it wanted without mercy or apologies. To many, it was a terror that they only braved when there was no land left to travel. \nIsla saw it with the eyes of someone who had lived within its hold for years. The swell and fall of its waves were the lullaby that had put her to sleep growing up. The dark undulating land before her was one no man could map, but she knew it as others did not, just as her father had. It was as much a part of her as the blood that coursed through her veins. \nAs she stared at the endless sea a fire sparked in her deep blue eyes. The strength of her emotions seemed to brighten the gold that ringed the dark color. The source of her fire was the yellow glow of a lantern bobbing on the water and drawing closer. As the sun's rays cut into the night sky the shape of a stern took form. \nEven as the ship held hope, it also held danger. \n\\\"That the ship?\\\" Hawk asked, his bass voice tinged with a Seau accent, his charcoal eyes narrowing.\u00a0 \nAlways standing beside Isla, he was like an unbending presence. A ship's mast, erect and strong. \n\\\"That's the ship,\\\" she said, her voice a contrast to his own, light and tangled with a mixture of accents. It was a result of growing up around so many languages at once. She had no true home dialect but seemed to fit with all of them. \nThe two figures standing at the helm couldn't have looked more different. Hawk stood a head taller than Isla with midnight skin, shaved head, broad features and muscles that strained against his homespun shirt sleeves. Even twice her age the wrinkles by his eyes were hardly noticeable. \nHeading into her twenty-second year, Isla had golden-colored hair tied into a tail, sharp features, deeply tanned skin, and a lean, agile body. She was the picture of a coming storm, beautiful, captivating and deadly. \nHanging off one shoulder and secured with a strap across her chest was her father's coat. Despite the months of wearing it, it still smelled like him, the smell of the sea. The weight of it on Isla reminded her of the ghost that walked the ship, whispered instructions in her ear and still held the air of command she emulated. \n\\\"Captain Zev,\\\" Hawk said, \\\"you know this plan is-\\\"\n\\\"Completely foolish?\\\" she said, cutting him off and never once looking at him, her eyes forever trained on the beacon in the distance. \\\"Yes.\\\" \nThere was no other answer to give. Isla knew that was they were about to do was reckless to the point of suicide. But there was no other way. She could see no other way.\nHawk gave a nod, his arms crossed in front of his wide chest. \n\\\"As long as you are-\\\" \n\\\"I am.\\\"\n\nThe silence that followed was heavy with both companions' thoughts. Inside even as a sickening doubt wormed its way deeper into Isla's mind, she held to a fierce determination that was driving her forward. Though she could feel Hawk's cautions stirring around him, he said nothing. They both knew what lay ahead of them was their final option. It was this reason not a word on the subject passed between them again.\n\\\"Tell the men to get into position,\\\" she said. \nHawk took a step forward and bellowed her command. The men paused for half a second, listening then moved without question. The energy throughout the ship was electric, they all knew what that horizon held. It held a promise that no one spoke about, but all felt. \nIsla spun the helm a quarter to the left, the smooth wood an extension of her body. The ship picked up speed, finding a current within the ocean that only she knew the secrets of. The bow cut through the waves like it was pulled by a sea serpent. The men shifted their weight adjusting to the increased momentum, after years of feeling the pull their muscles instinctively knew how to compensate. \nWater crashed against the hull, sending sprays into the air. The droplets caught the sun's light and looked like diamonds. The wind whistled around Isla, kicking up her hair and brush her skin. In its grasp was the salty tang of the sea, a taste that kissed her lips. \nHer target grew steadily closer, their pace gaining with every minute. Isla never glanced back to the horizon. There was no need. Her timing was never wrong. Even if the men on the distant ship turned their gazes back, the first light of the sun would blind them to their pursuers. No warning call would be given, no alarm raised. Before the prey was aware of their danger, it would be too late to change it. \nThe stern became clearer, the sleek line of windows across the back was framed by carved moldings. It was a sign of wealth of the highest kind. The ship was made from cedar wood, the light color speaking of its recent construction. The sails were almost blinding in their pure white color. \nAll this confirmed what Isla had already been told. It was the newest kind of ship, built for speed. At this thought, Isla's lips twitched at what could almost have been a smile. All the craftsmanship could not compare to the power of the sea. A power she knew how to harness. \n\\\"Sparrow,\\\" Isla said. \nShe barely had to raise her voice before a boy not much older than fifteen, with brown curls, the angular features of a Lorian and a tanned complexion appeared beside her. Even at his young age, he stood at Isla's height, though the way he held himself said he was still learning the strength and feel of his lengthened limbs. \nWithout needing to be asked, he held out an eyeglass to her. The metal was cool in Isla's hands and familiar as the brass buttons on her father's coat. As Sparrow held the helm steady, she peered through the scope. \nThe deck of the other ship jumped into clarity. With a practiced hand, she surveyed the scene, counting the men, their alertness and the weapons. Among the sailors were guards in trim uniforms armed with swords and daggers. All of it was as Isla suspected it would be. She lowered the glass and handed it to Hawk, her gaze held by the approaching conquest. \n\\\"I have counted ten on the deck, five guards. All well-armed and if I'm not wrong ready to be relieved of their duties.\\\" \nHawk was silent as he confirmed her findings. The deck dipped and Sparrow clenched the spokes, holding them firmly to their course. With a simple gesture, Isla took control of the helm, counteracting the ship's jerk and tilt with the ease of a veteran. \n\\\"You're correct,\\\" Hawk said. \\\"But I judge from the stance and gait of the men that they are well trained. Even tired they will put up a decent fight.\\\"\n\nShe nodded to his knowledge. \n\\\"Sparrow, get my things.\\\" \nThe boy scurried away. The full force of the sun was cresting and Isla could make out the flag that snapped in the wind at the top of the distant ship's mast. It held the symbol of a shield with a ship at the center. It was the final confirmation Isla needed. \nSparrow returned, items in hand. Giving control of the helm to Hawk, Isla strapped her sword around her waist, pulling the leather tight. She accepted the dagger and secured it inside her boot. When she righted, the ship was only a few yards away.\n\\\"Tell Roland to prepare,\\\" she said, unhooking her father's coat from around her shoulder and handing it to Sparrow. \n\n\n\n"}

Now her family was going to visit her mother's sister and Jasmine for Jasmine's 15th birthday in July. It was the summer before Lily's fifth year at Hogwarts. She was excited to go back. Her troubles with Petunia were only increasing and her parents weren't really aware of it or at least weren't really doing anything about it. This is why Lily was so glad that Petunia decided to stay home for Jasmine's 15th birthday. She was Lily's favorite cousin and the only one that was a witch just like her, which is part of why Petunia elected to stay home. \nJasmine and Lily didn't see each other much, though. Jasmine, unlike Lily, didn't go to Hogwarts. Instead, she went to Beauxbatons Academy in Southern France because that is where her father went. It wasn't until after he graduated that he met Jasmine's mother, considering that she is a Muggle. \nUnfortunately, Jasmine's father died shortly after she started her first year at Beauxbatons Academy. It was a terrible time, and Lily felt so bad for her cousin. She didn't know what it was like to lose someone like that or even just someone that close to her before. Lily had never experienced that before, but she could only imagine the amount of grief that Jasmine was going through. She wished that she could have been there for her, but since they lived so far away, and Lily had just started her first year at Hogwarts, her parents decided it would be best if she stayed at Hogwarts for the time being. \nEver since then, Lily has made sure to see Jasmine at least once every summer. She was worried about her. The first time that she visited her after the death of her father was shortly after she got home from Hogwarts. She went over to her house after begging her parents to visit them to see how they were doing after everything that had happened. Jasmine's mother still appeared to be in shock. She had only just been getting over the shock that her husband was a wizard and that her daughter was a witch when she received the news of her husband's death. This being because Jasmine's father never actually told her mother that he was a wizard, well until he realized that his daughter was also magical. He wasn't sure if she would be a witch, so he had elected to stay quiet about it until he knew for sure. He ended up telling them both he was a wizard on Jasmine's 11th birthday. It shocked them both, even more, when he told Jasmine that she was a witch and that in the fall he wanted her to attend his alma mater, Beauxbatons Academy. Jasmine, being the Daddy's girl that she was, immediately agreed to go there. \nLily and her family had come to visit them shortly after that. By this point, Lily's parents had found out that Lily was a witch from McGonagall, a professor at the wizarding school Hogwarts where Lily would be going in the fall. Lily had already known that she was a witch and about Hogwarts from her new friend Severus Snape. Lily told Jasmine all about him, but she had left out the parts about the wizarding world after he told her that it was supposed to be a secret from the Muggle world. Lily had wanted to tell her cousin about the wizarding world and everything, but she was afraid she would react the same way Petunia was. She didn't want to lose the closeness that they had because Jasmine suddenly saw her as a freak instead of the cousin she always knew.\n\nSo, when Lily's family came to visit Jasmine's family for Jasmine's birthday party, neither family knew that the other knew about the wizarding world. Lily's family wasn't about to tell them about it after McGonagall had explained everything to them about the statute of secrecy. Jasmine's father had explained this to his wife and daughter as well, but that wasn't going to stop Jasmine from telling her favorite cousin. They were practically sisters even though they didn't see each other that much. They told each other everything. Also, Jasmine didn't think she would be able to keep such a huge secret from Lily anyway. \nThe party ended up lasting longer than the adults originally thought it would, so by the time it ended, it was too late for Lily's family to head back home. Luckily, Jasmine's house was pretty big and had two guest rooms. Lily's parents stayed in one and Lily and Petunia were going to stay in the other, but Lily really didn't want to stay with Petunia. Jasmine noticed this and suggested that she and Lily could have a sleepover in her room, which is what happened. \nIt was during this sleepover that Jasmine figured would be the best time to tell Lily about her being a witch, and so she did. At first, Lily was shocked, which Jasmine assumed would happen, but she didn't know it wasn't because of the fact that witches and wizards were real. Instead, Lily was shocked that her cousin was just like her, a witch. Once Lily overcame her original shock, she told Jasmine about how she was also a witch, which in turn shocked and excited Jasmine. For the rest of the night, until they both fell asleep, they discussed the wizarding world. Both were excited by the prospect that they would be learning magic in the fall, but also disappointed that they would be going to different magic schools. In the morning both families found out the other also knew about the wizarding world and it brought them closer together. \nAfter that day, the two girls became even closer than before. They were best friends and acted more and more like sisters than they did cousins. They were also both there for each other. Lily was there for Jasmine after her father died, and Jasmine was there for Lily each time Petunia would tease her or call her a freak. Though they were only there for each other in letters via owls and the postal service, it was better than nothing.\nThey almost kept nothing from each other, almost. There was one thing that Jasmine was not telling Lily, but only because she didn't want to burden Lily with even more worry. Also, by this point, Jasmine was used to it only because her mother had been doing this ever since Jasmine could remember. It's not like she was hurting Jasmine physically and what she said didn't really affect Jasmine as much as she used to. Jasmine did think about telling Lily after she told her about what Petunia had been saying to her, but she decided not to, thinking that it was too late to tell her about it. \nJasmine did realize that what her mother was saying to her was wrong and could be considered emotional abuse, but Jasmine also never thought her mother meant any of it. After all, she was drunk whenever she would say those things about her. It was obviously the alcohol that was affecting her and what caused her to call her own daughter a selfish brat and an ugly disgusting girl. Her mother never meant it. Also, she wouldn't get drunk all that often anyway, so it wasn't an issue until it became one.\nAfter Lily had visited that summer after Jasmine's father died, it became much worse. Her mother was still not hitting her, which Jasmine was very thankful for, but she was drinking more and more. Soon her mother was getting drunk almost every night. Therefore, she was almost always calling Jasmine a freak or selfish or ugly and a lot of other different names. \\\"None of that is true though,\\\" Jasmine told herself after each time it happened. \nJasmine could handle the words, though. She knew none of it was true and sometimes when her mother would remember, Jasmine even got an apology from her mother. Those apologies made it a little bit better, but Jasmine wanted her mother to just stop drinking. She tried to convince her to stop, but that always led to empty promises. By Jasmine's 3rd year at Beauxbatons Academy, she gave up on trying to help her mother, who was now an alcoholic. Instead, Jasmine just left it alone.\n\nSoon Jasmine and her mother just started to ignore each other. They would eat meals in silence and mostly keep to themselves. Jasmine would mainly stay in her room, especially after she saw her mother start drinking. She took comfort in writing letters to Lily and her friends that she had made at Beauxbatons Academy. None of them knew what was going on between Jasmine and her mother, and she didn't plan on telling any of them. \nEverything was still the same when Lily finally came to visit her for her 15th birthday. Jasmine was so excited to finally be seeing her cousin again. Their letters were nice, but they were nothing compared to seeing Lily in person. She hadn't seen Lily yet this summer because her family was really busy. So, she was very excited that they were able to come down for her 15th birthday. Jasmine was so excited that she didn't even notice that her mother wasn't up yet when she went and got breakfast and then got dressed. \n\n\n\n"}

He had a gap-toothed grin and shaggy, sandy blond hair peeking out beneath a Little League baseball cap. A bat was clutched between gloved hands, angled over one small shoulder.\nHave you seen this child? cried the poster. James \\\"Jimmy\\\" Grabowski, 10 years old, 4'3\\\", 65lbs. Missing since May 10.\nI sighed, shifted the package in my arms, and took a half-step forward. Over the last week, coverage of little Jimmy's disappearance dominated the local evening news. Not to be outdone, the daily newspaper ran a small blurb on page three, outlining any developments\u2014or lack thereof. Everything that could be said about the boy had been wildly disseminated\u2014his likes and dislikes, what he had been wearing that day, shoe size, and even what he'd had for lunch. \nAs clich\u00e9 as it undoubtedly sounds, this sort of thing just didn't happen in my small town of Streamfield, Massachusetts. Which isn't to say that kids didn't go missing (they did) but they invariably popped up a couple hours of later. Usually at their friend's house or half-way to grandma's and grandpa's. Hell, one of my cousins decided to run off one day because she didn't want to make her bed. My family found her ten minutes later, sitting on the bank of the Streamfield River that ran behind the clan compound.\nThe fact of the matter was that kids never stayed missing. \nIn this era, all you needed to do was hire a witch to perform a locator spell and poof\u2014kid found. But that was the strange part\u2014all of the witches and sorcerers the police department hired came up empty. It was as if Jimmy Grabowski simply ... vanished.\n\\\"Next!\\\"\nI looked up sharply and hurried towards the counter. \\\"Sorry,\\\" I apologized, plunking the package down. \nThe clerk glanced up at me; his bland expression vanished as he stared into my eyes. I knew that look\u2014fear, suspicion, and wariness, all wrapped up into one. \n\\\"How much?\\\" I asked, casually sliding the package forward. But inside, I felt the first itch of irritation. Even though witches and shapeshifters had been \\\"out\\\" to the world for over a hundred years, we still encountered the occasional prejudice.\nWell, mostly shapeshifters.\nPeople loved witches and sorcerers\u2014they could do magic, which made life inevitably easier, and some of them even had the ability to heal. We just turned into giant predators.\nThe man started, eyes sliding to the black rosette tattoos that peeked out from beneath the collar of my shirt. \\\"Oh, yes ...\\\" he muttered, and pulled the package towards him.\nWhile he punched numbers into his computer, I rocked back and forth and stared at a spot on the wall behind him. \n\\\"A-anything hazardous, perishable or liquid?\\\"\nWow, I hadn't seen anyone so worked up since I was a kid and watched a mother literally drag her children away from us at the local park. \\\"No. But I will need insurance and confirmation.\\\"\nIn the end, I gave him a twenty and pocketed the change. As the clerk handed me the receipt, he also included a slip of laminated paper about the size of a playing card: Jimmy Grabowski was once again staring at me.\nI took it, even though there were five others sitting in the passenger seat of my car. Nodding to the clerk, I left the post office. His sigh of relief floated back to me as I pushed through the doors.\nAs I slid into the driver's seat, my phone rang. Tossing Jimmy's card in with the others, I dug into my purse and pulled it out.\nLAURA, blinked the caller ID.\n\\\"What's up?\\\" I asked my sister-in-law. \n\\\"Hey, Aly, where are you?\\\"\n\\\"Just leaving the post office. Why?\\\" Glancing up at the review mirror, I frowned. With my pale complexion, oval face, wavy black hair, and purple eyes, I wasn't exactly drop-dead gorgeous, but I liked to think that my face didn't scream \\\"monster\\\".\n\\\"Everything's fine, but you need to come back home.\\\"\nOdd. I pursed my lips and glanced at the bag of socks Mom wanted me to exchange at the big box store. \\\"What's going on?\\\"\nLaura sighed. \\\"I was trying to keep it brief, but my brother is here. He wants to talk to the clan about the Grabowski boy.\\\"\n\\\"No shit,\\\" I breathed, eyebrows sliding upwards. Laura's brother was a detective with the Streamfield Police Department. He was also the lead investigator on the case. \\\"Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.\\\"\n\\\"Okay, bye.\\\"\nTossing the phone into my purse, I buckled up and backed out of the parking spot. The socks were definitely going to have to wait.\n\nChapter 2\n\nFifteen minutes later, I pulled onto Michaels Drive, so-named because Michaels were the only residents on the cul-de-sac. The majority of shapeshifters, at least in small towns and cities, lived in clans. We called ourselves \\\"clans\\\" rather than \\\"packs\\\" because not all of us turned into wolves. While it was true that wolves made up the majority of shapeshifter families in America, there was no shortage of big cats, coyotes, bears and foxes.\nBeing a part of a clan granted you safety, security and a pretty good lawyer. Even if someone didn't live on clan land, they usually belonged to one.\nA total of twenty houses were on the street, all in various stages of renovation. Unlike normal people, we stayed close to our families, forming groups of three generations or more. It wasn't unusual at all for parents to build their kids a cottage in their (albeit big) backyard. \nMy grandparents lived in the biggest house, as benefiting my grandfather's position as clan leader. It was also the oldest residence on the street, dating as far back as the settling of Streamfield in 1688. \nOriginally built by my English Michaels ancestors as a farmhouse, it had been updated and expanded almost every century like clockwork. Currently, my grandparents occupied the center portion of the house, while my paternal aunt and her family lived to the right. Our section was on the left. Each of the three parts was its own separate residence, complete with kitchen, living room, and several bedrooms and bathrooms. We even cordoned off the massive basement, but left the doors open in case of emergencies.\nI pulled into the large, shared driveway and parked my car behind Dad's big black pickup. To the far right of the Clan House, a gravel road sloped downwards into what had once been farmland. A bright red arrow pointed down the lane, just below a sign proclaiming \\\"Michaels Customs\\\". \nAs I got out of the car, I could see several vehicles parked near the office/show room\u2014more than could be found on any normal day of operation. One of them was a cruiser. Shouldering my purse, I trekked down the road. In the distance, the workshop loomed; although it was after business hours, the buzz of saws and drone of planers was still audible.\nThe office door was unlocked and I yanked it open. \\\"I'm here!\\\" I called out. The reception area, where I normally sat, was dark, illuminated only by the small, bendable light over my desk.\n\\\"In here, Aly!\\\" My father's voice drifted down the hall.\nPausing, I took note of several messages scattered across the desk, sighed, and ambled towards the back of the building. A group of thirteen people\u2014mostly black-haired, purple-eyed shifters\u2014sat around a large oak conference table. Each face was familiar and expected\u2014except one: my sixteen-year-old cousin, Rachael. Why is she here? Judging by the look on my aunt's face, she was less than pleased about the whole situation. \nI didn't doubt that my cousin had somehow weaseled her way into an adults-only meeting. Rachael didn't like missing out on \\\"cool stuff\\\" and did all that she could to ensure she was part of it.\nAt the head of the table, seated next to my grandfather, was Laura's brother John Merrickson. Bald as a cue-ball and broad as a barn, Detective Merrickson could scare the piss out of practically anyone with a simple glance. He looked up when I entered, all seriousness and duty. Suddenly, I felt as if I had entered class late.\n\\\"Sit next to Mom, Aly,\\\" Dad said, waving to me.\nI didn't need to be told twice. I scurried to an open chair next to my mother and plunked down with a enough force for the chair to bounce.\n\\\"Here,\\\" I said to my mother, sliding her the change and receipt for the package.\n\\\"Not now,\\\" she murmured, covering the items with one hand.\n\n\n\n"}

Payday isn't until tomorrow either and the bottle shop won't give you a tab. I know because I've asked. I'd just have to ride the night out with what I have and go pick up more tomorrow. I can do that. I might have a slight drinking problem but I'm not an alcoholic.\nI suppose I am, and I have a lot of problems. Annoying, pathetic idiosyncrasies that make me unbearable to be around. Unlovable. Although, it's no wonder I'm the way I am, on account of my condition coupled with the fact that I grew up an only child having parents who didn't even like me, let alone love me.\nWell, I did have a sister once. Allison. For thirteen short months, I wasn't an only child. But then there was a horrible accident and it was no one's fault, but at the same time, maybe a bit my mother's.\nI blamed her for it anyway.\nI know my father blamed her. He never said it outright or even insinuated it \u2013 at least not in front of me \u2013 and I may have only been a five-year-old kid at the time, but I could tell he thought she was at fault.\nNo one talked about what happened. I still don't now\u2014not that I ever have anyone around who I feel the need to share deep, dark, emotionally laden secrets with. \nI did see a child psychiatrist after it happened. Regular appointments, once a week for about a year. After all, I was there. I saw it happen and seeing something that brutal messes with a child.\nI remember one day overhearing my parents talking.\n\\\"Doctor Conwell says Starla may end up forgetting it,\\\" my mother said. \\\"But only if she's not reminded about it. She's so young after all.\\\"\nBut I never forgot.\nI don't recall a lot about my life from before Allison, although I remember everything thereafter. I recall, even at such a young age, knowing my mother hated me. She resented my existence. She'd lost a beautiful daughter who may have grown up to be perfectly normal and now they were left with only me. Me and my problem.\nWhen I was twelve, Mum couldn't take it anymore. She swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills, washed them down with a bottle of vodka, and ended her role in suffering the burden that was her little Starla Lee Mires. Dad sure as hell didn't want me either. My parents couldn't cope with me together, let alone him by himself; therefore I ended up being his sister's burden\u2014my Aunty Dora, took me in.\nIt wasn't long before she'd had enough of me as well. She never said so, but I knew. I was such a handful though. Take my condition and heap on top of it a big, stinking pile of your typical teenage shit\u2014and then some. Drinking. Stealing. Fighting. Boys.\nI wouldn't have blamed her if she kicked me out, but I didn't give her the chance. Without so much as leaving a note, I left of my own accord when I was fifteen and I doubt neither she nor my father ever looked for me. I haven't spoken to either one of them since.\nNow it's just me and my condition.\nMy... gift? I'm not sure I can call it that, although some people would. Naive idiots who don't have to deal with it themselves.\nIs it a curse?\nMaybe it's a bit of both, but either way, I hate it. I wish I never had this problem. If I didn't, my parents would have loved me. Things would have been different; I would have been different. However, things aren't different and this is how I am. How I will always be.\nGifted.\nCursed.\nPrescient.\n\nChapter 2\n\nI knew it was only a dream\u2014I've had plenty like it before\u2014but that didn't stop part of my subconscious mind thinking it was real. This curse connected me to the woman, after all. In this dream, I was her. The victim.\nMy coercing sub-conscience tricked me into thinking this was happening to me and not to her, making my blood pump frantically through my body. The sweat was seeping through my pores. It was that part of my mind making me feel physical pain as the man took his fists to her\u2014to me\u2014repeatedly. \nI begged him to stop, yet I knew he wouldn't. This was worse than any time before because I dared try to leave him and he caught me\u2014he caught her. Now she needed to be punished.\nI woke up screaming his name.\nA name I didn't know.\n\n\n\n"}

I stop recording on my phone but end up sending the voice memo to my sister with the time stamp because it's the perfect thing to top the twenty-one messages she sent me throughout the day. I can't stop chuckling to myself as my fingers curl around the thermal, albeit mock, \\\"turd\\\" neck of my shirt. I'm stealing that phrase now and forever.\n \\\"Shot! Shot! Shot!\\\" a group of people cheer as two guys race to lift the small glass cups up and slam them back down against the wood. A bunch of people come trampling towards the bar to join in the shouts. The caramel color of the liquid means it's most likely tequila that's dribbling down their faces. \n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I glare directly at the guy that elbows my boob, but I don't know whether it's sweat or saliva that hits my skin through the ripped holes in my jeans. Even though the bartender happily poured the drinks, he now also doesn't look very pleased as his fingers curl around the towel draped over his shoulder. \n Most of the crowd trickles away once all the shenanigans are over. The bartender wipes, and the two guys pretend their throats aren't on fire with pursed lips and red faces. \n My rings feel cool against my skin as I tug at my black \\\"turd\\\" neck again. The throat fire is something I sometimes relish in, but today I opted for ros\u00e9 that's barely brushed my lips. It doesn't help that it's usually always hot in here to begin with. \nI guess it worked though, albeit painfully, as two girls slide up next to the two guys. I suppose I'll never know if that was their intention, but then again, with the way a grin slides up the side of the one guy's shadowy face, I suppose it was. The other guy, albeit thrilled, looks more queasy. \nOkay, I'll stop. I'm cringing at myself. \n I'M CACKLING. My sister follows the text with a series of laughing emojis, and my lips quiver again. I send a few laughing emojis of my own as someone slides up next to me. The guy is a few inches away from being too close for comfort, but that's because of the club's Saturday night sprawl. The sleeves of his navy-blue thermal are rolled up to his forearms. His dark arm hair matches the dark eyebrow that tips up when he passes me a sideways glance.\n \\\"Did that hurt?\\\"he asks.\n I wait for the rest of the catch phrase, something about heaven, all the while trying to remember the something about hell comeback. But the guy just shifts his lazy stance, still not picking his forearms off the edge of the bar countertop. I'm sure that as soon as he curls back up to his full height, I'd match him, even without the little heel on the bottom of my boot.\n \\\"That's cartilage, right?\\\" the guy nods in my general direction, and the gears in my brain finally click back into place.\n \\\"Oh, yeah\u2014no.\\\" I lightly touch the silver stud resting in the top of my right ear. \\\"But this one\\\"\u2014I turn to the right and tuck my hair behind my ear to reveal my tragus piercing\u2014\\\"hurt like a b*tch.\\\" The guy grimaces a little, so I continue, \\\"but it's nothing compared to my sister. She has five going up one ear.\\\" I draw the line up with my finger.\n\\\"My sister once dragged me to one of those astrology piercers.\\\" The guy cracks a smile but it quickly transforms to a wince. \\\"I think I'm more of a tattoo guy.\\\"\n I laugh. \\\"I think I'm the opposite, but where's your tattoo?\\\" I lean forward a little.The guy tugs his already half rolled up sleeve a little higher. There's a small black outline of a lotus flower resting just outside the crook of his right elbow with three dots trickling out the bottom.\n \\\"That's pretty,\\\" I hum.\n He shifts his shirt back down a little, but keeps his body angled towards me. \\\"Not as pretty as that.\\\" He gestures towards my head.\n My body stills before I breathe out a laugh.\\\"Oh.\\\"\n \\\"Birthday princess, huh?\\\"\n \\\"Yeah.\\\" I sigh as I reach up and rip the plastic tiara out of my hair. I forgot it was there along with the red velvet cupcake wrappers my friend and I left scattered on the bar in front of me. I quickly snatch them up in my fist before the bartender can unleash his potential wrath on me. Even though these cupcakes and silly tiara were Taryne's idea. She's around here somewhere, probably making friends. \n \\\"Are you from around here?\\\" the guy asks. I fight the urge to roll my eyes as my brain reminds me of yet another cheesy pick up line. As in Tennessee, 'cause you're the only ten I see. Even though we're closer to Malibu than Nashville.\n \\\"Shot! Shot! Shot!\\\" Another round ensues with the pair of girls this time, but the guy beside me is the one that gets elbowed instead of me. Now he's definitely too close for comfort, but he flashes me a quick smile in attempt to hide his wince.\n \\\"I'm Jack by the way.\\\"\n \\\"Louis Lane,\\\" I say with a curt smile before ripping at some of the hot pink feathers on the silver tiara.\n  \\\"Lame?\\\" His brows furrow.\n \\\"Lane,\\\" I repeat but my heart thumps a little too hard against my chest because the lie is way closer to the truth than it usually is. Yesterday I was Princess Peach. The day before I was Sandy because this one guy said his name was Danny. And turd neck guy was even told, \\\"Amy.\\\" \n \\\"Well\\\"\u2014Jack leans back into his own personal space, or at least tries to\u2014\\\"I was going to say you were being a little too hard on yourself because I think that'd be a way cooler disguise for superman than some dingy pair of glasses.\\\"\n I breathe out a laugh through my nose and rip out another hot pink feather, scattering them on the bar. I'll blame the bachelorette party on the other side of the room with their feather boas. The music continues to pound around, pulsing through the place like a heartbeat. The bars on either side under the second floor platforms are like the ribs caging it all in.\n Just when I finish making the tiara feather free, Jack rips it from my hand and digs it into his mass of dark hair.\n \\\"How does it look?\\\"\n The blue and purple lights strobe across his chest, but I hear nothing regarding the beat they're matching. The grin on his face shines in his eyes, and my teeth sink into my lower lip, but it's no use. The smile stretches across my lips before I can help it.\n\n\n\n"}

A flimsy concept.\u00a0\nThe number one thing everyone wants to take care of, everyone's first priority. It was that one thing that scared a whole lot of people, and still that thing\u00a0 that made the world go round.\nI've seen a lot of movies, Netflix is to be thanked for that. Movies taught me everything I needed to know about how life worked, how people lived, how they talk and interact with each other.\u00a0\nI know that in life, one should have the three Fs, friends, fun and family. It was a very important thing I learnt from movies. Although, I lacked two of those Fs in my life; so... Yeah, this brings me to reality... My life, and also the reason why I didn't believe in whatever I saw in movies.\nMy life is quite different.\nYou don't understand? I'll explain.\nMy life has been nothing but a rollercoaster of hospitals, medicines, check ups and test runs. My life is--\u00a0drama filled.\u00a0Each day I see and hear new things, from the hospital patients to the doctors and nurses, down to the eye-rolling, dramatic cleaners.\u00a0\nAlthough, the only place I ever had the liberty of visiting, was the hospital.\u00a0\nMy life consisted of two places, the hospital and my house.\u00a0\nI wasn't complaining or anything. It was just that wonderful prospect... I'm an 18 year old guy who has never been anywhere in his life, but a hospital and his house... That's wonderful, I mean- it makes me feel different, almost special.\u00a0\nAnd I sure as hell am not complaining.\nSo, this brings me to the point of this whole concept.\nI will never understand why my parents think I need to experience this side of life.\nHigh school.\nMy mom's white Toyota corolla LE Eco, rolled up to a stop in front of the gigantic school she had talked about all week. Boldly printed in archaic looking gothic font, the giant letters ICHS, seemingly hovered in the air, until I realized they were held to the glass wall that made up the front of the school with small metal pegs.\u00a0\nShow it off much?\nMy eyes left the font at the glass walls, to the people at the school grounds.\nStudents.\nThey were everywhere... talking, laughing, just hanging around and catching up on whatever it was normal teenagers talked about. The sound of chattering, murmurs, laughter and happiness, filled the air.\nIt fazed me, you know. Most of them were kids my age, and they looked really happy, they look so full of life...\u00a0\nWell, they are full of life.\n\\\"Colby, we're here.\\\" My Mom's voice cut into my thoughts.\u00a0\nWhen I was about to lose focus, my eyes landed on a particular girl. She looked the happiest. Her coffee brown hair was pulled up in a tight ponytail, leaving few curly strands around the sides of her face. She wore blue jeans, paired with a green T-shirt. The grin on her face was unfaltering, as she handed out flyers to everyone she could.\n\nI really did not know what caught my attention about her. Maybe it was the smile on her face? Or the hope? Or the high level of positivity just radiating off of her.\u00a0\nOr maybe it's just because she's the exact opposite of me.\n\\\"Colby-\\\"\nI looked away immediately, glancing towards my Mom.\u00a0\n\\\"I might use recommended glasses Mom, but that doesn't mean my eye conditions are so horrible to the extent that I can't actually see what's in front of me.\\\" I told her.\u00a0\nHer smile made her look younger. The wrinkles by her eyes made her look more... vibrant. \\\"You didn't answer me the first time, and you looked like you weren't in this car with me.\\\"\u00a0\nI exhaled, letting my head fall back at the seat head. \\\"You know I don't want this Mom.\\\" I let out, feeling exhausted.\u00a0\nHer smile went down slowly as she gave her reply. \\\"You don't know what you want until you actually get it, Colby.\\\"\u00a0\nGroaning, my head lazily turned to the school grounds again. \\\"I've seen high school movies... Netflix has actually told me all I need to know; this will be drama after drama, and that is the last thing I want right now. Drama.\\\"\n\\\"Have you ever experienced drama, Colby?\\\" She asked in an honest tone.\nMy head turned to her direction again, as I blessed her with a blank look. \\\"Everyday of my messed up life.\\\"\u00a0\nShe chuckled. \\\"I don't mean that kind of drama, Colby... I mean high school drama.\\\"\u00a0\nI took my eyes off her, staring at the not so lonely road ahead. \\\"You know I haven't... Home school is actually better, less stressful and all.\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"That's the point. You don't know anything because you've been homeschooled all your life.\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"Then why can't I enjoy what's left of it back home? In the safe confinement of my room, where you can find less people.\\\"\nShe sighed and shook her head, reaching out to stroke my hair... I didn't stop her. In a month from now, she won't have that opportunity again.\n\\\"Your dad and I think it's better for you to get out there. You don't have friends Colby, you don't know what highschool is like... You're 18, this is a time you don't want to miss... This is that point in every teenager's life where they feel more alive. I want you to experience that before-\\\" She stopped herself, almost as if she was scared to say the words.\u00a0\nI turned my attention back to her. Her eyes had suddenly taken that dull glow they took, anytime a discussion about my health came up. She took in a deep breath and exhaled, forcing a smile on her face.\nAll I could do was stare.\nMy mom was the strongest woman I'd ever known, you hardly ever see her breakdown... She would hold herself together, and then slap on a reassuring smile.\u00a0\nIt's so amazing to watch, yet sad.\u00a0\n\\\"It's okay to say it.\\\" I said out of nowhere. \\\"The sooner you come to terms with the fact that I have a month left in this hell hole you call a world, the sooner you practice how to contain yourself when the inevitable happens.\\\"\u00a0\nThe smile wiped off her face, and I knew what came next.\nReprimanding.\n\\\"Colby-\\\"\n\\\"Before you call me stupid,\\\" I stopped her from talking. \\\"I didn't say that to make you sad... I'd never do that... It's just- I'd hate it if you lose yourself when I'm gone. I don't want you to stop being the person you are because of me. So... Practice makes perfect.\\\" I smiled.\n\nShe shook her head. \\\"You really are a piece of work, Colby... My piece of work.\\\" Her eyes shifted to the school grounds. \\\"You should get going.\\\"\nI groaned. \\\"I don't think I'll like it here.\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"That's why it's called highschool.\\\" Her smile widened.\u00a0\n\\\"You really are my father's wife.\\\"\u00a0\nShe smacked my shoulder. \\\"Get out of my car before I push you out.\\\"\nI narrowed my eyes at her, unlocked the door and stepped out.\u00a0\nShutting the door behind me, I took in a deep breath with my eyes closed, inhaling the slightly strange air outside the mini world that the four walls of my room made.\nWhen I opened my eyes back up, nervousness crept up my skin in the form of goosebumps.\u00a0\nI blinked, adjusting my glasses.\nQuickly, I turned back, bending so I could talk to my Mom. All I wanted to do was jump right back inside the car and go back home. \\\"Come pick me up early, or else I'll walk home.\\\" I said in a rush.\nShe smiled sweetly at me. \\\"It'll be fine Colby.\\\" Her voice was reassuring.\u00a0\n\\\"I'm kind of scared, Mom.\\\"\nShe smiled. \\\"I could just come right out and give you a hug if you want.\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"No. That would be the talk of the school. I've seen highschool-\\\"\n\\\"Colby, breathe.\\\"\nI took in a deep breath and let it out again.\n\\\"Please just come pick me up early.\\\"\n\\\"I will or your Dad will. Enjoy your first day, I love you.\\\"\u00a0\n\\\"Ditto.\\\" I muttered, about to rise to my full height before she stopped me.\n\n\n\n"}

Now, Troy only stopped his stalking because he'd received some sort of alert on his phone.\n\\\"What's the news?\\\" Chuck asked, hoping he could keep him distracted. \nIf the trio's ringleader was distracted, there was a chance he could make a run for it and escape before they'd be able to do anything.\n\\\"Read about it yourself,\\\" Troy answered with another evil grin. \\\"Oh, that's right, you don't have enough money for your own phone, do you? Your alcoholic dad spends all his money on booze.\\\"\nChuck felt his cheeks instantly flush. \\\"He is not my dad.\\\" Wallace wasn't his real dad, just a pale imitation of one and forced onto him by the foster care system.\n\\\"Ooooh, that's right. You're so poor, you can't even afford a real dad.\\\"\nTroy's insult didn't even make sense, but his pals, Derek and Erik, either didn't know or didn't care. Each laughed like a couple of rusted car engines that couldn't turn over. \nA-rawr-rawr-rawr. A-rawr-rawr-rawr.\nEach of the twins was massive. All three of the bullies were bigger than most kids at school, but those two were something else. If there were molds of what an offensive lineman on a football team should look like, it would be them. Mean spirited, muscles on muscles and ready to plow into anything that even looked at them the wrong way.\nThe pack of boys continued their advance. \nWhy did I come this way? Chuck thought as he backed up another step. Usually, Chuck took the school bus or walked home on one of the main roads, but today, he thought he'd ditch the bus and cut through the woods behind the school. Bad idea.\nThat's when Troy, Erik and Derek caught him. They were just hanging out, throwing rocks into the creek. They'd been trying to scare off the ducks and hit turtles sunning on rocks, but then they spotted him.\nVultures.\n\\\"So, what'll you give me if I tell you the Marvel news?\\\" Troy teased.\n\\\"My undying gratitude,\\\" Chuck said sarcastically.\n\\\"No, no, no.\\\" Troy wagged a giant finger at him. \\\"This is a cash only transaction.\\\"\n\\\"I don't have any money. You said it yourself. I'm so poor.\\\"\n\nA dumb expression fell over Troy's face. He hadn't thought of that, but then the rusted wheels of his brain started turning again. Ever so slowly.\n\\\"Maybe we should check your bag anyway. Boys.\\\"\nQuicker than Chuck thought they were able, Erik and Derek seized each of his arms and pulled them straight out, so he was forced to stand like a human \\\"T.\\\" Chuck's backpack fell to the ground. The boys had steel grips. No matter how hard Chuck pulled, there was no way he'd escape until they decided to let go. He was breathless in seconds from trying to get loose.\n\\\"Let's see what we have here,\\\" Troy said, already dipping into his bag.\nHe dumped out the contents. Schoolbooks, papers, pencils and a bit of loose change piled on the ground. \n\\\"That's enough for a soda at lunch.\\\" Troy pocketed the coins. \\\"But not enough to pay for the news. Sorry, pal.\\\"\nChuck hated these guys. They were always doing dumb things to stir up trouble\u2014crude jokes in class, pranks on younger kids, and when it suited them, stealing from you. If he could make people like them disappear, he'd do it in a second. No question.\n\\\"Just tell me what it is,\\\" Chuck said. \\\"Better yet, just let me go and I'll just watch the news on my own TV.\\\"\nTroy looked at him. \\\"You have a TV? Wow, I'm surprised. You get it used or something?\\\"\n\\\"Yeah, we got it on sale at the thrift store,\\\" he said, sure to add another thick layer of sarcasm. \\\"It's really old. Like, there's still a VCR on the bottom, it's so ancient.\\\"\nAnother dumb expression washed over Troy's face. \\\"What's a VCR?\\\"\nChuck couldn't hide his laugh, but when he noticed the rage surface on Troy, he tried his best to cover it up like a cough. It didn't work. The jock crossed the distance between them in a flash. Guy was the school's wide receiver for a reason: he was fast. And like a raging gust of wind, he rushed into Chuck's face in two skips of a heartbeat.\n\\\"You think I'm stupid, Chucky-boy? How stupid do you think I am? Tell me.\\\"\nChuck could practically taste the kid's breath. That's when it hit him that he'd gone too far with his jokes this time. He looked away. \\\"No, I don't think you're stupid, Troy.\\\"\n\\\"You laughed like I am. Didn't he boys?\\\"\nErik and Derek laughed again, clearly enjoying the show as they held his arms fast. A-rawr-rawr-rawr.\nChuck swallowed hard. His hands went all cold and clammy. \\\"I was just ... surprised.\\\"\nBefore he could prepare, Troy punched him in the stomach with a quick jab. Every ounce of air inside his lungs rushed out in a mix of lightning pain. Chuck felt like he might throw up. At least, the boys released their grip and let him fall to the ground.\n\\\"Surprised now?\\\" Troy said. \nThe tone was almost singsong. He enjoyed tormenting him. Then, he bent down to Chuck's ear, so close he could feel the breath on the fine hairs across his skin.\n\\\"Oh? And the news is that your favorite magician is holding a contest. He's giving away his entire fortune, but it's not like you could actually have a chance. You're too big a loser to even lose the contest. They wouldn't even let you enter. Come on, guys.\\\"\nThe pack walked off and Chuck just stayed on the ground. He curled into a tight ball and waited for the pain leave his body. \n\n\n\n"}

There's a misty fog hanging in the air, parting or disappearing to allow a passing car through before it swallows the vehicle up as if it never existed.\nSnow crunches beneath her feet, accompanying the sound of the sliding doors closing again, and she sighs at the winter chill that somehow slips beneath the fabric of her scrubs and raises goosebumps on her skin. Even with her coat wrapped tightly around her frame, the cold is too intense to handle. \nAs a person who adores winter weather, she should be ecstatic about the blizzard coming down around her, yet she isn't. She finds herself yearning for an impossible shaft of sunlight to cut through dawn's preceding gloom. It's unlike her, and she has a creeping suspicion that it has to do with being trapped inside of a dark, sleeping hospital all night.\nLast night was her first night shift at the hospital. \nHer position there is fairly new, so she wanted to learn the ropes and gain a little confidence before taking on something as daunting as the night shift. \nBut, after a month of becoming comfortable with her new job, she decided at the last minute to come in after her manager sent a mass text about being understaffed. They were promising an extra couple dollars an hour to anyone willing to annihilate their healthy sleep schedule\u2014which, let's be candid, never existed in the first place\u2014to spend eight hours of their life drawing blood and giving bed baths. And, to make matters worse, it was a particularly boring night.\nJo sat at the Nurses Station, fresh out of tasks to complete, with a pen pointed at the inside of her arm. The ink dried on her soft skin the form of a miniature smiley face that stared back at her plainly as if in jest, to remind her of her own downturned features.\nIt isn't that she dislikes her job, she doesn't. What makes her hate being here is that she has to be. Too much of the same monotonous thing has never done her any favors.\nHer stomach grumbled all night, and she couldn't wait for her four AM break to quell the hunger she accidentally sparked by forgetting to eat dinner. She went downstairs for a quick bite as soon as the clock struck four, but the cafe she favors in her usual day shift wasn't open. \nHer hunger, exhaustion, and night shift fueled moodiness is why she's distracted on her walk to the train station a few streets from her hospital. Usually, she's sure to be vigilant and alert while walking alone in the pathways of the unfamiliar city she recently began working in. Today is different. All she can think about is getting food in her belly and eight hours of sleep before she has to show up for her afternoon shift.\nIt's Christmas and a weekday, so she dreads returning. Holidays are busy, and while there is a type of busy that makes the day go by in a blink, this is the other type. This afternoon will be the, \\\"Oh my God, if someone has one more ridiculous request, I'm gonna start ripping my fucking hair out,\\\" type of busy. At least she has time to nap and eat first. If she had to work two shifts back to back on a holiday, she'd leave and never return.\nThe first inkling of danger that she feels as she strides down the sidewalk, careful not to slip on patches of ice here and there, she ignores. \nSomething lingers in the pit of her stomach, crooning in her ear to turn around and not come back, but she forces it away. If she were to acknowledge it, perhaps she'd think about how odd a sensation it is.\nThere's hair standing on the back of her neck, goosebumps from the winter chill, and the ever-present feeling of someone watching her, but then there's something else. Right beside the fear and danger, a protective presence urges her to flee. She doesn't know why it's there, or if it's an imagined presence, but it's there all the same.\nSnowflakes twirl and prance on their graceful plummet to the earth until they inevitably join the blanket of snow already covering the sidewalk. It's a little less heavy, though, as she reaches a stretch of sidewalk beneath the overpass on which the train tracks lie.\nIt feels extra damp, dreary, and dark beneath the cobblestone bridge, and she begins to get this sharp sensation in her heart as if her body itself is warning her to stop. But she doesn't. Stupidly, this was the one day she forgot to bring her pepper spray, and she ignores every instinct inside of her that warns of something dangerous lurking in the shadows around her.\nOnce she reaches the edge of the overpass, where the cobblestone wall opens to a small staircase down to the alleyway, it strikes.\nShe shrieks in horror at the feeling of multiple pairs of hands grasping her. \nOne of them covers her mouth and silences her, muffling her instantaneous cries for help, as they yank her from the open street and into the alley. If only she had her pepper spray, then she'd at least have a chance. Without a weapon, these people\u2014men, she notices\u2014are far stronger than she dreams of being. Everything she knows to escape situations like these evades her. She is left with is a blind, consuming panic that leaves her thrashing clumsily against her captors.\n\\\"Help!\\\" she screams into the hand molded over her mouth. \\\"Please! Hel\u2014\\\"\nHer plead for mercy is cut short when one of them, the leader of this group, shoves her up against the wall hard enough to make her forehead bounce onto the stone with a horrifying sound. Once, twice, three times, four\u2014a hand is wrapped up her hair as leverage to bash her against the cobblestone as harshly as possible. \nEverything from here on is viewed through a different, distant lens. It's too fuzzy for her to pick up what they're saying, but she knows that they're speaking and touching her. She feels hands tugging at the scarf around her neck and her jacket in a frenzy.\nIt's at this moment that she accepts her fate. \nShe's going to die here. She's meant to die at the hands of a few sadistic strangers who see nothing more in her than a weak stranger to take advantage of, and that will be the legacy she leaves her family. Missing on Christmas Day, vanished without a trace\u2014it's a perfect mystery. As one of the men wraps his hand in her hair and yanks her head aside to reveal her neck, she supposes she might feel the caress of a freezing blade soon.\nSurprisingly, since her head won't stop ringing and she believes this to be the end, she can't find it in herself to rebel. All she can do is sob quietly and dig her fingers into the cobblestone enough to crack the tips of her nails. \nAnd just when she feels the sharp tips of what feels like two needles grazing her neck, the man holding her in place is ripped away. Her body slumps against the wall and slides until she collapses on the wet, snow-covered pavement. She still faces the wall, so she only sees a formidable tower of stone in front of her, but it's what she hears that keeps her focused enough to remain conscious. There's yelling, hitting, and struggling all around her. \nVaguely, she is trying to move and gain her strength again, but she must have been hit too hard. She's capable of groaning in pain and wriggling on the ground, not much else.\nFading in and out of the line between consciousness, her ears pick up the eerie sound of bodies thumping to the ground, and she has never wished to stay awake more than she does now. She has only crawled a few feet away from where she initially dropped to the ground, hand reaching to brace itself on the first icy stair before a new pair of arms slips beneath her back and knees to hoist her up.\nThe stranger isn't warm or comforting but they hold her with less violence than her other captors. Her body hangs like a rag doll in his arms\u2014another man, she notices by the build of him\u2014and she views the world upside-down, dangling head bopping with every frantic step he takes.

Then again, any other girl wouldn't have picked up the smell at all. \nI peek around the corner and see two teenage boys, one much younger than the other.

The younger boy looks nervous, but determined.\n\\\"I need your wallet!\\\" the boy with the knife demands.\n\\\"Look, I already told you, I don't have anything on me. I'm out for a run,\\\" says the other boy. His voice is impressively calm considering, but I can still hear the edge of fear in it.\nI'm not sure if I want to get involved or not. Mom and Dad always remind me to keep a low profile. The knife definitely looks sharp, but the young boy is wavering, hands shaking ever so slightly, like it's his first time. \nAnd then I smell wolf on him. \nHe's a Shifter.\nI set my doubts aside and step into the alley. The movement startles him and he pushes the knife against the other boy's chest. \\\"Don't come any closer!\\\"\nI stop where I am. Pulling my hands out of my pockets, I push my shoulders back and straighten to my full five-nine height. I fix a long, penetrating stare at him. \\\"This isn't your territory.\\\"\nHis eyes widen in recognition when he finally catches my scent. \\\"But I need to get the wallet.\\\"\nI blink slowly and lift my chin as I've seen my father do countless times. \\\"You won't be getting it here.\\\"\nThe boy scowls, trying to size me up.

But something about his blue eyes tell me that giving him my name would be okay. \\\"Maddie,\\\" I say at last.\n\\\"Maddie,\\\" he repeats with a nod. \\\"One more question.\\\"\nI give him a nervous glare. Stay out of other people's business, my parents echo in my head. The more you know about them, the more they want to know about you.\n\\\"Last one, I swear.\\\"\nWhen I nod my assent, he asks, \\\"Are you a wolf, like him?\\\" He tilts his head in the direction of the alley where the other boy fled.\nMy stomach drops. I didn't expect the question. How can he possibly know anything about that? As far as he knows, that kid was just your garden variety juvenile mugger, right?\nI tug at the black knitted cap on my head. \\\"You don't know what you're talking about.\\\" I spin back around to resume walking, ducking my head against the chill November breeze.\n\\\"I'm Aiden by the way!\\\" he calls out to my retreating back.\nI don't stop. Whatever he thinks he knows about wolves, he doesn't know anything about me.\n\nChapter 2\n\nBrookfall is one of those sleepy little towns nestled in the foothills of some small California mountain range. Plenty of trees, creeks, and open spaces. Perfect if you're looking to get away from it all. \nOr away from something specific.\n\\\"Maddie, are you going to unpack or keep staring out the window?\\\"\nI keep staring out the living room window. \\\"Mom, why did we buy a farm? Are we farmers now?\\\"\nShe chuckles. \\\"It's not a farm, it's an orchard. A lot of them had to shut down due to the drought. This place was a bargain. You know what ten acres of our own land means?\\\"\n\\\"Uh... lots and lots of weeds?\\\"\nA sweater hits the back of my head and I turn away from the window. My mom wears a look of pure joy on her face. \\\"It means I can run free, anytime I want. I don't have to drive an hour just to find a spot. I won't have to worry about hunters or campers.

You'll fit right in before you know it.\\\"\n\\\"I thought I was supposed to avoid people.\\\"\nHer expression softens. \\\"Sweetie, we never said that. You just have to be careful how much you reveal about yourself. We want you to have friends.\\\"\nKeep to myself, but make friends. Got it.\\\"Sure, Mom. Don't worry about me.\\\"\nShe squeezes my shoulder and plucks at my beanie. \\\"Do you always have to wear this thing?\\\"\nI tug it back down. \\\"I like it.\\\"\n\\\"It covers up your beautiful hair.\\\"\nI pull a chestnut lock off my shoulder and examine it. \\\"Like it matters if anyone notices.\\\"\n\\\"Maddie... you're antisocial by choice.

And anyone who meets me today would tell you I do too. They would tell you I'm just like him. \nOnly I'm not. Not exactly.\nMy parents used tell me about how happy I was as a child, making friends everywhere I went. That I was just like my mother. I had her hair, her eyes.

On his cycle home he thinks about his chances of getting into Dartmouth Collage. \n\n#college, #comedy, #funny, #fiction, #highschool, #humor \n\nDoctor\u2019s Appointment\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\n\\\"I forget.\\\"\n\\\"I asked for your date of birth.\\\"\nMy eyes finally move from the melanoma poster back to the receptionist's face. Hospitals have always given me the creeps, and the chairs always hurt my back, and for some reason, whenever I go, I seem to be the only one there. For some people, that might be nice, but not for me. All the receptionists always stare at me, and the nurse that walks into the waiting room to call me in never even calls my name. I mean, what if when I was washing my hands in the gender-neutral bathroom, somebody took my seat and stole my appointment from right under my nose? I wonder if people do actually steal other people's doctor appointments. \n\\\"Oh, uh, November 15,\\\" I don't know why I stutter; of course, I know my birthday. Well, I guess I didn't know the first time he asked, but still. Something about the way the man is looking at me makes me uneasy. Maybe he thinks I'm stealing somebody's appointment. See, I told you! That does happen! \nI guess the receptionist buys it cause he hands me a clipboard and tells me to take a seat. I find the chair that looks like it would hurt my back the least, and sit down, the chair sending out a squeak that fills the entire room. The receptionist stares at me. Great. To avoid looking back up at him, I get started on the questionnaire attached to the clipboard he gave me. Okay, question 1: How much sleep do you get a day? Easy, 8 hours. 2: Do you use electronics within an hour of when you go to sleep? Yes, I mean, who doesn't? I keep filling out the question until I get to 14: Are you sexually active?\n...\nDoes that one time count?\nI'll just put no. I keep on filling out the form, the pen occasionally falling out of my grasp due to my sweaty hands. Why am I so nervous, anyway? Trick question, I'm always nervous, but it just really comes out talking to the doctor's receptionist. I'm scheduled for a regular checkup, but there is that one spot on my back that I can never see or touch. What if it has one of those moles that I saw on that melanoma poster? Ew, they looked so gross. So lumpy... My hand subconsciously makes its way to my back in an attempt to reach the untouchable spot as another patient walks through the automatic doors. Finally, I'm not the only person in this forsaken waiting room. He looks my way as I quickly divert my eyes. I could only get a quick glance at his black hair before I'm finally refocused on the questionnaire. Okay, number 30: How much juice do I drink? How should I know? I'll just put down zero, or none, I guess. And with that, I finished the questionnaire, finally.\nI clutch the clipboard close to my chest, only the fabric of my hoodie blocking the cheap plastic from hitting my abdomen. I wonder what kind of diseases are on this thing. Rather than being patient zero, I decide to place the clipboard down in the chair to my right. But, when I put it down, it doesn't hit the uncomfortable material of a hospital chair. It hits a pair of khakis. A pair of khakis worn by the guy who walked in a few minutes ago, who is now sitting next to me. How did I not know he was sitting right next to me? And why did he choose this chair? I look around. These are the only two chairs in the entire waiting room. Fantastic.\nMy hand starts to shake as I turn my head to look at the guy sitting next to me. My mouth goes dry as I try to form an apology, \\\"Uh... S-Sorry. I, uh, didn't know- I didn't know you were sitting there.\\\" Wow, Darrion, what a way with words. The man to the right of me just gives off a chuckle, telling me it's no problem as my face gets as red as the Scarlet Letter. At this point, I might just walk out of here and let somebody steal my appointment slot. Luckily, the nurse comes out and calls my name, to my surprised delight, as I walk through the double doors into the medical hallway. Right before I can't see the waiting room anymore, I turn back to see the man staring at me, the familiar chuckle emanating from his mouth.\n\nAnother great doctor's appointment.\nI've never known why they put full body-length mirrors in the doctor's office. Like, the doctor doesn't need a mirror to see me, and I see myself naked enough times to know what I look like. Yet, once again, I'm staring at my disproportionate body in the mirror. I guess everybody thinks their body looks off; it's a common thing in teenagers. For me, I think my legs are an ungodly amount of length, while my chest is squished. I have a stare-down with the man in the mirror. At least my hair looks okay, my brown locks combed back and to the right in my signature hairstyle. My eyes look pretty green today, but maybe it's just the fluorescent lighting that shines throughout the room.\n\\\"Everything looks good, Darrion,\\\" My doctor comments as he steps away back to his computer. \\\"You can put your clothes back on.\\\"\nThank the lord. I quickly pull back on my underwear and jeans, buckling them up, and throw on my hoodie as well.\n\\\"Was there anything you wanted to ask me? Any concerns?\\\"\nOf course, I have concerns. Who doesn't? Let's see... I'm concerned that when I stand up, I sometimes pass out. I'm worried that my elbow sometimes locks in place that probably started when my dad forced me to try out for football my freshman year. I'm concerned that the few grey hairs on my head signal that I'm going to die young, or worse, go bald way too early. But instead of telling my doctor these things, I say the usual.\n\\\"Nope!\\\"\nI probably said that a little too quickly, but he doesn't notice. Or maybe he does and just ignores it. Either way, he gives me some closing remarks, telling me to not stress myself out too much with senior year and college and all that jazz, and sends me on my way. I thank him before walking through the door, back down the hallway, and into the waiting room. The only thing on my mind is the man that was sitting here earlier. Please lord, if you are up there, please have this man be gone. I don't care why, but I just can't see him again. If I do, there is a 90% chance I will die. Thank you. \nI step out the double doors back into the room with only two chairs, and to my relief, nobody is sitting in either of the chairs. I can finally breathe. Heading to the doors that lead back to the world, I thank the receptionist and push the door handle to feel the cold air hit my face. I head over to the bike rack and promptly unlock mine, pulling it out from the railing.\nYes, I know what you're thinking. I'm a senior, and I still bike. Let me explain. 1) Biking is good exercise, and at this point, it's the only exercise I get. 2) Biking is better for the environment than cars, and I'm all for conservation. 3) I'm absolutely scared shitless of driving. I've seen way too many car accidents on the news to feel safe behind the wheel. So, instead, I bike. I hop onto the seat and place my helmet on my head, clicking the strand together under my chin. Riding out of the parking lot, I'm hit by the cold winter air, which somehow feels good. It doesn't get too chilly where I live, which means that I'm not absolutely freezing. But that also means it doesn't snow, and I love the snow. I've only been in the snow once or twice in my whole life, but I just know that I would love to live there permanently. Something about the white powder lining the streets and trees is just so pleasing. That's why my dream school is Dartmouth, known for its winters up in New Hampshire. Going there for college is this dream reality I love to escape to before I head off to bed, yet it's probably a reality I will never live. As you should know, Dartmouth is an ivy league school, schools infamous for declining countless students and ruining their dreams of a successful future. And I'm just an eighteen-year-old from a random town in California. Maybe if I was from one of the big cities in this state, I would have a better shot, but instead, I'm just from the middle of nowhere. From a school that no one has heard of. The admission officer reading my application will probably think it's a joke, and they'll just chuck it in the trash along with the other inferior, rejected students. With the acceptance emails being sent next month, my application might already be in the garbage, the poor name of Darrion Gubart being grouped along with the other rejects. What a lovely thought.\n\n\n\n"}

If it does, I'm too stupid to decipher them. All I see is an endless stretch of blue with some clouds that are too lazy to move and are just sort of hanging around above us, aimless. I can't blame them, to be honest; the heat is brutal in San Aburrido this time of year, so lazing around is really all you can do during the day. \n\\\"Hey, look,\\\" Aaron says. He's lying on his back next to where I'm sitting on the bleachers, one arm lifted to point at the sky. \\\"That one kinda looks like Frida.\\\"\n\\\"Uh-huh.\\\"\n\\\"Feli,\\\" he laughs. \\\"You're not even looking.\\\"\nI tear my eyes away from his face and look at the cloud he feels resembles my family's cat. \\\"That's supposed to be her?\\\" I snort, squinting up at the shapeless white blob. \n\\\"Yeah. There's the ears and the tail... Look, you can even see the little chunk of her ear that got bitten off by Mrs. Robinson's cat last summer.\\\"\nI shake my head, laughing as I look down at him again and put a hand on his forehead. \\\"I think you have heatstroke.\\\"\nAaron slaps my fingers away with a grin. \n\\\"And put some respect on her name,\\\" I add. \\\"It's Frida Kahlo, not Frida.\\\"\n\\\"Shit, sorry,\\\" he laughs, raising his hands in defeat. \\\"Don't tell your abuela I said that.\\\"\n\\\"She'd call you a blasphemer and refuse to ever feed you again.\\\"\n\\\"Good God. I would never again get to taste her chile, her menudo, her flan...\\\"\n\\\"Tragic,\\\" I chuckle. Item number two hundred and thirty-three: the way he can say some Spanish words without the trace of an accent by now.\nAaron grins and directs his gaze at the sky again. In the sunlight, his brown eyes look like honey. Beads of sweat glitter against his dark skin; on his forehead, right above his upper lip, and on his collarbone, just barely visible when the collar of his patterned button-down shirt slips down a little. I swallow and look down at the playing field instead. \nThe old tennis court hasn't been in use since the 90s, or that's what I've been told. The bleachers and the field markings, though faded, are still there, but the asphalt is cracked in places and the net is long gone. Now it's just a random hangout spot for people like us who have nothing better to do on a Tuesday afternoon.\nBelow us, in the shade of the trees that grow along the sidelines of the court, sits another group of teenagers. They're a clique from our high school, three boys and two girls who dress like they're living in a big city and not San Aburrido, this tiny suburb somewhere in Arizona, a few hours away from any place worth mentioning. \nWe call them the White Teeth Teens. Aaron's dad came up with the name, I think. He's a dentist and talked about how those kids have the cleanest teeth in the whole town. We found it funny, so it stuck. The title fits them because everything about them is shiny; their fancy cars, their jewelry, the girls' lip gloss, their teeth when they laugh with their mouths wide open. I wonder what that's like, to always have fun and never worry about anything. \n\\\"Dude, can you imagine what things will be like a year from now?\\\" Aaron suddenly asks, ripping me out of my thoughts. \nDespite the scorching heat, I feel a cold shiver running down my spine at the question. With my tongue frozen to the roof of my mouth, I shake my head. The icy pit in my stomach has become a familiar feeling ever since that afternoon a few months ago when Aaron sprinted into our garden waving an envelope from UCLA. He got in on a scholarship because he's crazy good at track. I got into the University of Arizona like I got through the last two years of school; reluctantly and by the skin of my teeth.\n\n\nTwo colleges, seven hours apart. The beginning of the end. \nAaron has finally given up his staring contest with the sun and thrown an arm over his eyes, so he doesn't notice the way the color drains out of my face. Oblivious, he muses, \\\"I'll be in L.A. and you'll be in Tucson studying to become the best journalist the world has ever seen. I bet all of this will seem even more boring then, compared to all the college parties and stuff. Nothing here will change, but we'll be totally different.\\\"\n\\\"But the summer will be the same,\\\" I mutter. \\\"You'll come home. Right?\\\"\nAt that, he cracks his eyes open again and cranes his head back to offer me a grin. \\\"Of course. In the summer I'm all yours.\\\"\nAll it takes is six words from him to make my heart feel the same way it does when I go down the stairs and miss a step; that split second of shock when your body realizes you're falling before your brain can really comprehend it. Except I've been falling for years now without ever finding my footing. Aaron makes sure of that every time he says shit like this and he doesn't even notice. \n\\\"Fuck off,\\\" I laugh and shove my hand into his face to stop him looking at me. \nBefore he can respond, a shadow suddenly towers over us. Raising my eyes, I realize that it belongs to none other than Chloe Montgomery, one of the White Teeth Teens. She's standing with her hands in the pockets of her dress -yellow, with sunflowers on it- and a smile on her face as she looks down at Aaron.\n\\\"Hey,\\\" she chirps, brushing a strand of blond hair behind her ear. \nAnd just like that, Aaron is suddenly sitting up, leaning slightly forward, elbows braced on his knees. His voice is a little deeper as he smiles at her and says, \\\"What's up?\\\"\n\\\"Not much,\\\" Chloe giggles. \\\"It's so weird, isn't it? School is really over. No more homework, no more exams. I think I have to re-learn how to relax in my free time.\\\"\nAaron laughs, a deep rumbling sound that I only ever hear when other people are around. I'm used to his little snorts and cackles and the high-pitched dolphin noises he only makes when you tickle him on the inside of his elbow. \\\"School really brainwashed us, huh?\\\"\n\\\"Yeah...\\\" Even though she's just tucked it behind her ear, she pulls the strand of hair out again to twirl it around a perfectly manicured finger. \\\"So, do you have any plans for the summer?\\\"\n\\\"Not really. My parents and I are going to France for a week. Other than that I'm just gonna be spending as much time as possible with this guy,\\\" Aaron says, reaching over to ruffle my hair.\nI duck away, biting back a pleased smile. \nChloe's eyes briefly flicker over to me at that before she looks at Aaron again. \\\"You know... my parents are going to be gone for a few days and I was planning to host a party, just for a few people from high school before everyone leaves. I was wondering if you'd like to come?\\\"\nInstead of responding, Aaron turns his head to look at me. \\\"Are you down?\\\"\n\\\"Oh, uh... Of course you're also more than welcome, Felipe,\\\" Chloe quickly says.\nThe mere idea of a White Teeth Teen party at Chloe Montgomery's house makes my stomach feel like I'm approaching the highest point of a rollercoaster I didn't want to go on in the first place. Still, because it's Aaron, I give a nod.\n\\\"We're coming,\\\" Aaron says, grinning up at Chloe again. \\\"Thanks for the invite.\\\"\nChloe nods and sends him another blinding smile before she twirls around and skips down the steps, leaving behind a cloud of vanilla-scented perfume. I watch as she crosses the tennis court and goes to sit with her friends again; they whisper and laugh when she reports her success, glancing at us over their shoulders.\n\\\"They're talking about you,\\\" I murmur.\nAaron only shrugs. \\\"Let them talk. Soon we're out of here anyway.\\\"\nWhen he says it, it sounds like something to look forward to. He casts one more glance in Chloe's direction before he gets to his feet and says, \\\"Come on. My mom made iced tea earlier.\\\"\nLike always, I follow his lead and trail behind him, down the bleachers \n\n\n\n"}

Dust swirled out, coating the shiny black paint with a fine film of good country dirt. \nLiz leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, a frown on her face. The only time black cars like this showed up in her yard was when something bad was coming. The past few weeks had been nothing but bad, so her radar was obviously up. She steeled herself to deal with whoever it was that had arrived, and straightened.\nThe driver side door opened, and her step-father's lawyer poked his salt-and-pepper head out, expensive sunglasses winking in the early afternoon sun. \n\\\"Hello there!\\\" he shouted as he waved, a big, lawyer-sized grin on his face. Liz's insides clenched. It wasn't as if Frank was a terrible person, he was nice enough. It just meant dealing with more of the shit left behind when Brett West had keeled over three weeks ago, dead as a doornail, leaving the entire ranch, and her family, in the lurch.\n\\\"Frank! What brings you out this way?\\\" she asked as friendly as possible, walking out towards the car, wiping her hands down her jeans.\nFrank grabbed her hand and shook it vigorously, lifting his sunglasses.\n\\\"Elizabeth, my girl! I'm here with some paperwork for your mom, Tanner, and Brady to sign. Going to finally read this dang will too. They about?\\\"\nLiz nodded, and pointed back towards the cattle operation barns. \\\"I'll walk you over to the boys. Good drive from the city?\\\"\nFrank nodded, and hefted his briefcase, smiling again, a flash of perfect white teeth punctuating the moment as he slammed the car door. Liz wondered why he couldn't have couriered the paperwork, but then she didn't pretend to understand how lawyer stuff worked. Plus, you had to be in person to read a will, didn't you? \nThey walked in silence, Liz's well-worn work boots a contrast to Frank's shiny dress shoes. They were expensive leather, she could at least tell that. They'd buried Brett in his best boots, a beautifully tooled pair of Boulets that he'd not been able to wear for years with his gout acting up, making them painful. She hoped, from wherever he was, that he was appreciating that he at least got to wear them one more time. \nTanner was coming around the corner of the barn when they walked up, and he stopped, his frown mirroring Liz's.\n\\\"Frank! What brings you out this way?\\\"\nFrank chuckled and stepped forward, shaking Tanner's hand. Tanner's eyes narrowed, and he shared a look with Liz, indicating he too was feeling apprehensive about an unexpected visit from his dad's lawyer. \n\\\"I have some papers for you to sign, son, and I need to chat with you, Peony, and Brady. I also have the will ready to read.\\\"\nTanner nodded and gestured towards the office off one side of the large cattle barn. Liz turned to go. This was none of her business, she wasn't blood family. She had things to do.\n\\\"Liz, wait. You're part of this family too.\\\"\nShe turned and Tanner was still standing, waiting for her to follow them, beckoning her with an outstretched hand. She sighed, and followed him reluctantly. Dammit, he was right. Her mother had been more fragile the past bit, so it might be good she was here. \nTanner jabbed angrily at his phone with one finger as they entered the office, and a few minutes later, her mother poked her head in the door.\n\\\"Frank! What brings you out this way?\\\" she said as sat in one of the beat up old chairs by Brady's desk, shooing a cat off of it with little kissy noises. The cat scurried off out the door towards the main barn, hissing. Liz wished she could do the same thing, high tailing it out instead of clamping down on the uneasy feeling something bad was about to happen. \nFrank chuckled again and threw up his hands, his grin wider, the humour in him bubbling out. \\\"If Brady asks me the same thing, I may just lose my mind.\\\"\nLiz smiled despite her sour mood. Family thought alike, it seemed.\n\\\"Now Frank, don't you dare. I need that mind to deal with the mess my husband went and put us in,\\\" Peony chided, her own large smile mirroring his. Liz watched her mother delicately cross her legs, wincing slightly at the pain, and she gave her a concerned look, to which her mother made a sourpuss face back. \n\\\"Frank! What brings you out\u2014\\\" Brady said, then stopped as everyone else broke into laughter.\nFrank threw up his arms, Brady looking around in confusion, but let it go as Frank pulled his briefcase over and opened it, signalling it was time for business. \n\\\"Okay. I have some standard forms for you to close out the old man's bank accounts, that kind of stuff,\\\" Frank said as he passed over a sheaf of documents to Peony. She glanced at them quickly, handing them to Tanner, who then proceeded to look them over carefully. \n\\\"Says here to transfer all remaining balance to the working accounts on the ranch. Can he do that? What about Peony?\\\" Tanner asked abruptly, looking up sharply from the papers. \\\"Doesn't she get to have a livable income?\\\"\n\\\"Now hang on, Tanner. I'm sure that's not the case,\\\" Peony said, while Brady peeked over Tanner's shoulder. Tanner pointed out the line to him, and Brady sucked in a breath. \n\\\"All of it?\\\" he murmured, eyes swivelling up to his step-mother. \nFrank folded his hands and Liz felt her guts rile up. Here it was. The real reason he drove out the documents and will on the same day, instead of a fax or an email. She knew it. Bad was happening.\n\\\"Jesus, Frank. What is it?\\\" Peony said quickly. \\\"I know that look. Something's up. Enough with the paperwork and will reading. Why are you really here?\\\"\nFrank looked around the room and nodded. \\\"Okay, okay. Now that the death certificate is signed, I can let you in on Brett's final wishes. He asked me not to until it was time.\\\"\n\\\"Time for what?\\\" Tanner asked, setting the papers down, and folding his arms, his eyes snapping fire. He was close to popping, his famous temper simmering close to the surface, his jaw was so tight he could likely pulverize diamonds between his teeth. \n\\\"Well, I don't know how much you know. But I found Jake,\\\" Frank said, frowning. \\\"He's due here this afternoon, and then I can read your father's will.\\\"\n\\\"Who the hell is Jake?\\\" Brady asked, coming around to perch on the desk, his own arms folded to mirror his brother. \n\\\"So you don't know. Shit,\\\" Frank muttered, and ran a hand down his face, glancing at her mother, who automatically looked guilty, averting her eyes and hunching with the stress of that statement. \n\\\"Know what?\\\" Tanner growled through his teeth, standing up and balling his fists. Brady put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head when Tanner looked back at him. Liz went to her mother's side, seeing her mother's hands move to her chest.\n\\\"Mom?\\\" she murmured, but her mother wouldn't look up. Her mother knew who Jake was. That was certain.\n\\\"He's their older half-brother,\\\" Peony said quietly, gesturing over at Tanner and Brady. \\\"Heather's son.\\\" \nTanner sat back on the desk with a thunk, and Brady went a little wide-eyed, running a hand over his head, his hair flopping through his fingers. Both of them were silent.\n\\\"What brother? They don't have another brother, so you'd better explain this one more time, in detail,\\\" Liz said for them, the shock of what her mother had just said obviously making the West brothers speechless. Which, honestly, was a first.\n\n\n\n"}

She goes shopping with her parents before term starts at Hogwarts. \n\n#cedric, #cedricdiggory, #harry, #potter, #fanfiction, #fan-fiction, #fanfic, #fanfiction, \n\nLiliana and Cedric\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nDear Cedric,\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking. I've been spending a lot of time reading and studying, which has been really fun. To me, at least. I know it's a different story for you. Although, there's a book I'm excited to tell you about, I think you'd really like it.\nAnyway, I hope you've been doing well,\nLiliana paused. What else could she write? 'I miss you so much' seemed too telling. She wouldn't want Cedric to figure out that she fancied him through a measly letter, would she? She wasn't about to let five years of friendship go down the drain because of a slip-up in a letter.\nMaybe she should just make the statement about all the boys. That would make it far less suspicious\u2014or so she hoped.\nI've been missing everyone (including you, obviously).\n'Obviously'? Should she keep that in? Was that too much?\nWas she overthinking this?\nWith a sigh, she crumpled up the parchment paper and tossed it in the bin under her desk. The school term was starting in a couple of days anyway, she was sure he wouldn't mind if she responded to his letter in real life.\nLiliana laid back on her bed, her dark hair spreading across the soft pillow as her mind wandered about the boy she liked so much.\nCedric Diggory. Oh, she could go on about him for hours. The Hufflepuff boy whose brown hair was the softest thing she's ever touched; whose eyes were the most beautiful shade of grey that she's ever beared witness to; whose rosy cheeks made hers only blush to reach the same colour.\nBut he didn't like her back. Surely not, not the boy who everyone admired, who every girl fell in love with upon sight of him. Liliana had absolutely\u00a0no reason to believe that Cedric would choose her.\u00a0\nYes, he had been quite flirty with her at some times. But then again, maybe that was just his personality. Or maybe, Liliana pondered, she was making it all up in her head. Maybe, this whole time, he had just been very\u00a0friendly, much more so to her than the others, for some reason.\u00a0\nShe and Cedric, along with a few other boys, have been close ever since their first year at Hogwarts. Liliana had first met Riley, him being the most fun-loving boy in the group. He had curly, brown hair and deep brown eyes that matched her own, and constantly had an adorable grin that took up half of his face. They met on the train to the school, and he had then introduced her to Wesley, Devon, and of course, Cedric.\nWesley was definitely the most responsible person out of the three. Although there have been many girls who fancied him, liking his dark blond locks and crystal blue eyes, he's always brushed them aside, choosing instead to focus on his studies. She and Wesley usually studied together for their tests and complained together when the other boys bothered them for help.\nDevon, on the other hand, was a bit more like Riley, choosing play over work. His wavy black hair and hazel eyes caught the attention of many girls and boy, did he enjoy that. He would seem like quite the player to many, but once you got to know him, you'd discover that he's actually rather sweet (but sometimes very annoying). And while he was rather book smart, he did not have any common sense.\n\nAlthough the four boys had gotten sorted into Hufflepuff while Liliana was put into Gryffindor, the five of them remained as tight as ever. Unfortunately for her, her crush on Cedric had begun to bloom not too long after, and it didn't take too much time for the other boys to realize. And boy did they have fun teasing her about it.\nAlthough, sometimes, they were earnest as they encouraged her to confess her feelings. Whether or not they knew how Cedric felt was a mystery to her. Despite their motivating words, she didn't want to take the chance.\nShe did let her mind wander sometimes, just as she was doing as she turned onto her side, half of her face squished into the white pillow.\u00a0\nWas it possible that Cedric could like her back? He hadn't ever had any girlfriends, despite the fact that there were many girls who were more than willing to take the position. Liliana had always brushed that fact to the side, deciding that Cedric probably just wanted to focus on his studies and Quidditch.\u00a0\nBut could she be wrong?\nShe shook her head slightly. She shouldn't give herself so much hope, she may end up believing her thoughts to be true. \nHer mind then moved onto a different topic, wanting to stop thinking about Cedric before her feelings overloaded. The Chamber of Secrets.\nIt had been opened in the previous year, by a mind-controlled Ginny Weasley. Liliana felt bad for the ginger girl, it was her first year at the school of magic, and that was what she got?\nThe beast of Slytherin had spent months roaming through the pipes, petrifying students and ghosts whenever it pleased. Unfortunately, Hermione had been one of the students who had met this fate, right after realizing what the monster truly was: A basilisk.\nAs usual, Harry was the hero as he saved the day, killing both the basilisk and the memory of Tom Riddle, also known as being the younger version of You-Know-Who. Ron, who later complained to Liliana about it during the End-of-Year Feast, had been trapped with the ex-Professor Lockhart, who had lost his memory.\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were three years younger than Liliana, yet she felt as though there was no age gap in the least. Liliana figured it was because Hermione was mature, as it was just her personality; Harry had been through some rough shit, making him quite mature; and Ron had been friends with them, instantly making him sophisticated. Nonetheless, Liliana could confidently say that they were the best friends she had in Gryffindor. \nThey had met in Liliana's fourth year when the trio was in their first. She had found them studying in the library, offering her help when she saw the three puzzled faces. From then, she became a regular tutor for the two boys, Hermione having dealt enough with them. She began to join them on their adventures, although she missed out on the Chamber of Secrets (however, she wasn't too upset about that, basilisks seemed scary).\nLiliana sighed as she looked back to her white ceiling. There had been something immensely terrible that had happened each year for the past two years. Surely, something bad was bound to happen this year? \n\nChapter 2\n\nAs Liliana and her parents strolled through the busy streets of Diagon Alley, her eyes quickly ran through the list of textbooks she needed for her sixth year.\nSixth-year students will require:\nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 6 by Miranda Goshawk\nAdvanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage (if studying N.E.W.T. level Potions)\nConfronting the Faceless (if studying N.E.W.T. level Defence Against the Dark Arts)\nA Guide to Advanced Transfiguration by Emeric Switch (if studying N.E.W.T. level Transfiguration)\nAdvanced Rune Translation by Yuri Blishen (if studying N.E.W.T. level Study of Ancient Runes)\nFlesh-Eating Trees of the World (if studying N.E.W.T. level Herbology)\n\nShe wouldn't be taking Herbology nor Ancient Runes that year, so she could cross those two off the list. She couldn't say the same for the others.\n\\\"Do you need anything else other than textbooks?\\\" her mum questioned as they neared the book shop. \\\"New robes, quills, anything?\\\"\n\\\"I could probably use with some more quills.\\\" Liliana shrugged lightly as she pocketed the list. \\\"You can never have enough.\\\"\n\\\"I think the pile of untouched quills on your desk say otherwise,\\\" her father chuckled as they entered Flourish and Blotts, a frenzy of students and parents already occupying the space.\nHer mum frowned at the sight and she nudged her husband. \\\"I knew we should've come a day or two earlier, I mean, look at how many students there are!\\\"\n\\\"I'm sure they won't run out of textbooks,\\\" Liliana laughed. Even if so, she was sure there were extra ones at Hogwarts that she could borrow.\n\n\n\n"}

Whilst on the job a woman comes and confronts me.\n\n#investigator, #adventure, #british, #crime, #detective, #historical, #UK, #humor, #humour, #funny\n\nInvestigator\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": " \n\nApril 1976, Dudley, UK\nIt was half past twelve on a Wednesday in late May. That's where it all began, I suppose.\nI was sitting in my Beetle; picking the peanuts out of a Snickers, sucking them clean and dropping the hateful things out of the window into the torrent of water flowing in the gutter below.\nIt was raining. The incessant soul-crushing downpour that shrouds the length and breadth of the British Isles. Raining is not the most accurate term to describe the great swathes of droplets teeming from the leaden sky. They rattled the metal roof of my car and showed no sign of abating. I had been sitting there for two and a half hours, watching beads of water race each other down my windscreen.\nI got so desperate for entertainment that I started placing bets on the winner of the water races. I currently owed myself fifteen quid and had no way to pay. I'd most likely have to sell something to raise the cash before I sent the boys round to rough myself up.\nLike I said, it had been two and a half hours and the guy I was waiting for had still not shown his face. He had been off work at the Chow Down dog food packing plant in Dudley for three months. His sick note read lower back pain and his boss reckoned he was faking it; pulling an elaborate and months-long sickie.\nI think that if I did eight hours a day -- plus overtime -- packing and labelling heavy crates of tins, shifting those bastards around I'd have lower back pain, upper back pain, and all kinds of other pain.\nIn point of fact, his boss struck me as a nasty piece of work; the kind who polishes his name plate daily and gives that little brunette from Accounts a habitual squeeze on the arse that makes her feel sick.\nIt seemed to me that he wanted to be rid of an employee for some reason, probably to keep the sick pay in his sweaty fist or to defray the rise in the company insurance premiums. Whatever, I was his instrument; a Damoclean sword hovering outside the poor sod's house in a jet-black Beetle. I was to be the avenging thrust of the spear of industrial justice.\nBollocks.\nI get all the shitty jobs at the firm. My life seemed to have devolved into a non-stop succession of cases that involve sitting, excavating my sinuses with the blunt end of a biro and being amused at the potency of my own gas. Still, here I was on the cutting edge of private detection, existing in the shadowy world of potential employment fraud.\nMy partners in the firm, the Yeoman brothers, wanted me out. Their latest wheeze was to leverage their new-found majority stake to hold an Annual General Meeting at which, they delighted in telling me, there would be a vote on changing the means of allocating jobs between us.\nWe operated a first-come, first-served policy. That gave each of us a roughly equal serving of shite, and a statistically similar chance of landing the job featuring the smouldering jilted bombshell in the sheath dress, with a blood-red pout and a nutcracker cleavage.\nIf, as the Yeomans wanted, we moved to a system where clients could choose one of us individually then we would need to provide them with a means of determining that choice. We would need metrics, they said. Time taken to resolve case, favourable outcome percentage, pets found alive and well, that kind of thing.\nSuffice it to say, my metrics were shit.\nAll of which meant that I really needed a result on this dog food skiver business. Happy clients was very much the name of the game.\nOn that particular Wednesday, I'd spent a good long time just watching the street. People were coming and going, heads down, just getting by, the way we all do.\nA young mother turned into the road, dragging her three- or four-year-old son behind her. She carried two full-to-bursting shopping bags in one hand and with her other she was tugging the child along behind her through the rain.\n\nShe made a forlorn sight. Her hair was plastered across her face and makeup was running in dark rivers fed by the downpour. The young boy was straining against the woman's grasp like a recalcitrant dog, desperate to be free to either sniff or cock its leg against something.\nThe woman paid no heed to the boy's squirming and wriggling, she just wanted to be home as soon as possible and get out of the rain. Presumably she would sling the food into cupboards and the child in front of the TV. She would put the kettle on and change out of her wet clothes.\nMy mind dallied briefly on that final thought, but I swiftly kicked it into touch. I turned up the heater in my car, scratched my nose and shifted my weight from one buttock to the other for the thousandth time.\nThe guy's house looked OK. It was a nice little mid-terrace, two bedrooms. It was double-glazed and there was fresh paint on the door. There was no dog shit on the path or crisp packets stuck in the neatly-trimmed privet hedge topping the wall in front of the house.\nIt wasn't a stately home, but it was certainly well looked after and I wondered whether all the work was done by him. Sudden images flirted around in my head of the guy from the dog food factory shinning up a ladder like a rat up a drainpipe while I hid behind a lamp post and snapped away with my Pentax camera.\nPleased with my powers of observation and deduction, I rolled back my seat a couple of notches and wiggled my toes to keep the blood flowing.\nThe drenched woman with the soaking wet child stopped outside the house I was watching. She put down her shopping and began delving through her pockets. The bags behaved true to type and flopped, allowing several tins to roll away and into the street.\nThe woman swore and gripped the boy's wrist a little tighter as he wriggled; trying to break free and run after the escaping goods. She produced a bunch of keys from her handbag, opened the door, then lifted the child bodily and just about slung him inside.\nWith the kid out of the rain, the woman turned to gather her tins and bags from the pavement. As she rose she caught my gaze, held it long enough to make me feel like a pervert, and then turned and went into the house.\nShe was not bad looking in a lived-in kind of way and I wondered if she was single. I had been so long without a woman that a baboon hitting my dick with a plank would get me off in a matter of seconds. It even seemed like a good idea.\nI was just musing further on where I would find an obliging baboon, and whether I could afford the plank, when there was a tapping on my window. A little startled, I spun around. It was the woman, without the child, and she wasn't getting any drier. I wound down the glass; the very soul of anonymity.\n\\\"Can I help you?\\\" I proffered.\n\\\"Don't you fuckers ever get tired of harassing us?

A loved one dying unexpectedly. Getting cancer or some other terminal illness. But what most people would not say is the death of a dream.\u00a0\nUnlike the other two, watching as your dream slowly dies is a different sort of grief\u2014a different sort of pain. And unless you've personally experienced it, it is almost indescribable. It is a bitter, suffocating feeling that is equivalent to being knifed in the chest.\u00a0\nOr in Barbara Gordon's case, the sudden impact of thousands of pounds of steel pressed against her tiny body.\u00a0\nBut that was a story for another time, one already told hundreds of miles away back in Chicago. This story began with a long, winding road towards Barbara's final destination, a destination where people\u2014where dreams\u2014went to wither and die.\nThere was no doubt Barbara knew this while on that endless car ride over. The sullen look in her eye made her resemble a prisoner headed for the gallows. \nBarbara pressed her cheek against the cool pane of glass and sighed, watching as the vast stretch of pine trees passed by. She hadn't seen a building for the past hour, only the swampy wasteland that was the Pine Barrens. The next time she saw signs of civilization, it would mean she was entering the city limits\u2014that she was closer to her destination than she hoped to be. With each tree the car passed, the knot in her stomach grew tighter, and she was sure it was from her insides being all tangled up.\n\\\"Barbara,\\\" a soft voice called out next to her. \\\"Are you still asleep? We're almost there, honey.\\\" \nShe shut her eyes and slowed her breathing, hoping her dad would think she actually was. Oh, how she longed for sleep, but the peace she had sought after had eluded her since leaving Chicago. That was nearly twelve hours ago.\nBut how could she sleep right now with everything weighing on her mind? She had a better chance of walking again.\nA grimace crossed her lips at the thought. She couldn't start using dark humor as a coping mechanism. Only cynics did that and now was not the time to be cynical. Not when the pain was still raw. She had to keep hope alive... somehow. \nBut what light was there to search for in a city filled with nothing but darkness? \nShe opened her eyes to stare at the ugly, wet sight in front of her. She had read somewhere that the Pine Barrens were referred to as such because of the acidic and nutrient-poor soil despite the name. \nReading. That seemed to be all she did nowadays. All she could do after the accident. \nQuickly blinking back the tears brimming in her eyes, Barbara tried to think about something else. Something that didn't involve the sound of bones crunching against metal, and the searing pain that followed. Something that was far more pleasant and wouldn't make her lip tremble. \nHer father.\nThe last time she had seen him was at the hospital when he came to visit her. It hadn't been that long ago between then and now, but in her mind, it felt like a whole other lifetime ago. In a way, it was.\nThat Barbara Gordon, the one who could walk, would've been talking non-stop with her dad and singing along to her favorite tunes. \nBut this Barbara Gordon had been stuck in a car for the past twelve hours without exchanging more than a few words with him. \nAlthough she had hoped things would go better between them, she wasn't surprised they had turned out this way. Her dad had a knack for acting like things were normal when they so obviously weren't. Even when she came to visit, he would act like everything was a-okay.\n\nEveryone in Gotham did.\u00a0\nGotham. A city she thought she left behind for good. But in the cruelest twist of fate, she was now stuck here for probably the rest of her life. \nAs if on cue, water droplets started to fall on the glass as the first glimpse of the city's skyline came into view. Pushing her glasses up over the bridge of her nose, Barbara watched as streaks of lightning flashed above the dark outline of the city. What little sunlight penetrated through the overcast sky was dim. Despite the early hour, it already looked like night had settled over Gotham and Barbara had to double-check her watch to make sure it was, in fact, still the afternoon. \nShe turned away from the window, not wanting to dwell on the depressing sight in front of her any more than she had to. She would have plenty of time to do that once she got out of this car.\n\\\"Oh, good. You're up.\\\" Jim, her father, smiled down at her. \\\"We're almost there.\\\" \nBarbara rolled her eyes internally. Duh. She knew they were as much as she wished that wasn't the case. But if wishes were real, then she would still be a police officer instead of in a wheelchair. \nJim must've sensed her unease since he flipped on the radio dial and said, \\\"Well, now that we're in the city limits, what about some tunes?\\\" \n\\\"In a case that continues to boggle the Gotham City Police Department, a third Wayne Enterprises employee has disappeared.\\\" The reporter's voice crackled through the speakers. \nBarbara was about to turn back around and force herself to sleep when the chilling news headline made her sit up straighter. \n\\\"Kirk Langstrom, who recently merged his pharmaceutical company with Wayne Medical, went missing yesterday evening. He was last seen\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Huh?\\\" Barbara snapped her head to the side as the soft, mellow beat of The Eagles started playing. \\\"Why did you change it?\\\" \n\\\"If I wanted to hear nothing but bad news, I'd just go back to work.\\\" He chuckled at his own joke, one Barbara didn't even bother to crack a smile at. \\\"Anyway, I don't need to be reminded about this damn case. No one seems able to crack it, not even our best detectives.\\\"\nBarbara raised a curious eyebrow, sensing her dad's frustration. \\\"Well, do you have any leads yet? Any suspects?\\\" \nHe grew silent as they entered what Barbara thought was a desolate underpass. But while the blue fluorescent bulbs flickered above them, threatening to go out at any second and leave them in complete darkness, she could make out the vague outlines of haphazard tents and drifters. \n\\\"Just one,\\\" he finally answered in a hushed voice.\nBefore Barbara could ask what he meant, he turned to her with a stern look on his face. \\\"Don't worry about it, Barbara. The media is just exaggerating, as usual. Saying men should be careful at night. It's probably some sort of dispute with a rival business, and they're trying to send a message.\\\"\nBarbara crossed her arms and looked out the window at the grimy, graffitied walls around her. \\\"To who? Bruce Wayne?\\\" \nJim frowned at her but did not argue otherwise. \\\"So... um...\\\" he trailed off as if he were searching for the right words to continue. \\\"There's a surprise waiting for you at home.\\\"\nShe blinked. \\\"A surprise? Should I be worried?\\\"\nA wan smile crossed Jim\u2019s mouth as they drove out of the underpass and back into the murky light. \\\"No. At least I hope not.\\\"\nIronically, his answer just made her even more worried. \nSeveral guesses ran through her mind as to what this surprise might be. A dog? A new house? A party? Oh, how she hoped to God it was not a party. The last thing she needed right now was a bunch of strangers jumping out at her as she rolled through the door.\n\nBut as they came into view of the vacant driveway, Barbara realized the surprise was neither a new house nor a party. The house was the same drab one she used to live in, down to its same drab brick walls. Nothing had changed.\nAnxious to get out, she opened the door and took her first breath of the surrounding air. Cold and wet, just like she remembered. A shiver ran across her spine, making her wrap her arms around herself to preserve the fleeting warmth. \nAs she waited for her dad to take out the wheelchair, Barbara peered out at the cigarette butts and muddy newspapers littering the street. She wouldn't be surprised if she saw a rat come scurrying out of the gutter. \n\\\"Looks like nothing has changed,\\\" she said, wrapping her arms around her dad's neck as he hoisted her up. Even though he was up in years, Jim didn't lack the strength to lift her onto her chair. Barbara figured being the police commissioner must've kept him pretty active then, considering most middle-aged men would be huffing and puffing by now. \n\n\n\n"}

Sketski was just buying them time.

She writes a letter to him.\n\n#historical, #england, #letter, #husband, #christian, #christianity, #1800s, #fiction, #gentleman\n\nThe Letter\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\n2 November 1888\nDear future husband,\nGreetings. I hope this letter finds you well. (My governess has informed me that this is the proper way of beginning a letter. Now, onto the more interesting and less formal matters!) My name is Rosalie Winthrop, but you may call me Rosalie, or even Rose (though not Rosie!) I know that we have not met, but my governess has invented the vilest of punishments in forcing me to compose this missive. She\u2014that is, Miss Anne Wilson\u2014has insisted that letter-writing is one of the \\\"fundamental pillars of being a fine lady.\\\" Frankly, I know that she really is obligating me to do such a thing in order to improve my penmanship. \nNow, where was I? I am of ten years of age, soon to be eleven in four months on the 4th of March, and I live with my father in Grenledge Manor. My mother left when I was very young, and I have no other relatives. It can be fairly lonely, and I suppose that does lead me to point out the one benefit of writing these letters: perhaps I shall feel as though I have a friend or at the very least, someone to talk to who is neither hired by my father nor of familial relation to me. How very silly, is it not, to think that writing out my thoughts on a piece of paper, goose-feather-quill in hand and grey ink slowly darkening to black on the page, should be equal to some kind of companionship! Nevertheless, this shall be my decided pastime.\nCurrently, at Grenledge, it is snowing. When I have finished drafting this letter, Miss Wilson shall permit me to go sledding down one of the hills outside the manor, provided that one of the footmen accompanies us in the case that I injure myself. What are your hobbies? Is it snowing where you are? I should like to think of you somewhere warm and exotic, in a place far-flung from dreary and frigid England, somewhere like Jamaica or India or even the West Indies. \nWhat useless questions! You must forgive me for asking them if you ever do read this letter, whomever and wherever you are. For my father has not even selected a suitor, let alone formed a betrothal for me, and therefore my future husband is really more of a glorified diary or journal who certainly cannot reply to my queries. I do hope that such a comparison does not offend you - you are not the easily offended type, are you? I should certainly hope not, for Miss Wilson is all the time informing me that my words are too brash and outside the borders of propriety. I am afraid I must be off! My governess has told me that the sun is nearly set and the time for sledding will soon be past.  Future husband, I have returned! My hands are half-frozen and my hair is filled with snow despite Miss Wilson's best attempts at keeping my fur-trimmed hood and mantle on my head. Sledding is really perhaps one of the best things about an English winter, right after hot cocoa, a mug of which is warming my fingers at present as I continue my letter to you. What great fun I have had! If you, my future husband, do not enjoy sledding, I fear that I may have to seek an annulment. Of course, Miss Wilson has just read over my shoulder and informed me that well-bred ladies do not ask for annulments. \nDo you have a pesky governess as well? Or perhaps a tutor? Mayhaps you have a great deal more in the way of companionship than I do, with only my father and the staff for company. I love them all dearly, but I do long for a friend who is my own age at times. Then again, I have never known anything different. Perhaps I would surely hate having other children or 'young ladies' around. I could be a horrible deviator from societal norms and never know it, having no one to compare myself to! Surely I hope not. Or, even if I am... I do wish that my future husband, whoever you are, will love me in spite of it.\nLove is what a marriage ought to be about. Do you agree with me? Miss Wilson says that she is in only partial agreement, and lists dull things such as pounds per annum and reputations and titles as being factors in marriage, but I disagree. Certainly one needs money to survive and a good reputation is ideal, but love is surely the most wondrous thing in all of human existence. After all, there are so many books and Psalms and pieces of Scripture dedicated to it, that surely it could not be something terribly insignificant. \nSpeaking of spiritual matters, I have also decided that if one is going to write a letter to one's future husband without knowing whom their intended is, one also ought to pray for their intended. Seeing as you may never read this letter, I feel that I can safely write out my prayer for you in the confines of ink and parchment with no one the wiser. \nDear Heavenly Father, I pray that whomever my future husband may be, You would be watching over him and giving him strength in whatever struggles he may be presently facing. I pray that You would bestow courage upon him and that no matter his difficulties, he would have a comfort in Your presence. Amen. \nMy father calls me to supper, and I must be dashing off now. I am,\nSincerely Yours,\nLady Rosalie Winthrop\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nDreaming of the Seas: Eliza Banes moved to Plymouth with her wealthy family. Her mother wants her to get married to a boring gentleman, but she would rather go on an adventure. Her sister Katy comes to visit.\n\n#1800s, #adventure, #historical, #england, #fiction, #history, #seas\n\nDreaming of the Seas\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nJuly 1810. Plymouth, England\nEliza Banes wiped her eyes as she closed her novel. Oh, what a beautiful tragedy it had been! To fall in love with such a wild man, whose only love was the sea, and to win his heart in return, only to have their love dashed by smallpox. She could not have written it more perfectly herself. \nEliza climbed off of her bed and crossed her bedroom to her own personal book shelves. Her mother did not allow Eliza's books to be kept in the library. She did not like guests to think that they all read smutty romance, as she called them. Eliza placed the book back on the shelf, next to the dozens of others that she owned. \nAll of Eliza's books had something in common. They all took place somewhere faraway and romantic. She preferred adventure stories, the kind that allowed her imagination to wander far away from where her body physically was. She adored the passionate, wayward romance the characters experienced. Romances between classes, ranks, criminals and innocents. The passion and the emotion were so much better that way. And she liked them to end in tragedy, in heartbreak, and in loss. \nThere was no better way to feel love then to feel the loss of it, or at least that is what she had come to understand through her books.\nNot that Eliza would know. \nShe hated finishing a book. She hated returning to reality. Life was so much more interesting aboard a pirate ship, or on a deserted island. \nEliza's life was an endless parade of dull. Her parents, God bless them, had been restored to their fortunes, and so were at the height of Plymouth society. That meant dozens of droll parties and dances with the same droll men only after a rich wife to make heirs for him.\nEliza had lost count at how many proposals she had received and rejected. She really made no effort to seek attention. It seemed to follow her wherever she went. Her own mother seemed bemused as Eliza was always so sour at social gatherings. But the lure of money was more enticing than the woman attached to it, so most men could not have cared a bit at what she looked like, or how she behaved.\nHow she longed for adventure. How she longed for a life more exciting than her own. How she wanted a daring and dashing buccaneer to sweep her away to far off lands. \nTo be married to one of those horridly boring gentlemen was her destiny, she knew. It was how her books often ended. But she wanted the romance before she accepted the tragedy! She wanted passion and danger and exhilaration. \nEliza crossed her bedroom to the window and sat down at the seat in front of it. Her bedroom was perfectly positioned to overlook the sea. She could see so far into the distance, as though the horizon was never ending. What would it be like to sail toward that horizon? To sail away wherever one wanted, to follow one's spirit without a care for the consequences?\n\nWhat an awfully good adventure that would be. \nEliza had been staring out of this window for nearly the last four years. The house she now resided in was much larger than the cottage they had in Wilshire. They had so many rooms that a great deal of them were empty as they simply did not have enough furniture to fill them. \nThey had servants, too, and so Eliza's bedroom was never anything less than perfect, something that irked her terribly. She could never find anything. \nEliza could remember how excited she had felt in moving to Plymouth. Stupidly, she had thought it would be an adventure. Plymouth was a port town, after all. There would be ships, and pirates! She longed for the adventures that were to be had in Plymouth. \nBut she had been most seriously mistaken. Plymouth was indeed a port town, but she would have nothing to do with it. Her mother quickly established themselves within the society, and Eliza was doomed to tea with people that she had little care for, and dancing with those she despised. \nEliza Banes was a prize, apparently.\nShe had never been down to the dock. She had never even been on a ship, let alone left the harbour for the high seas. What was the point of looking over the ocean if it was not meant as torture?\nEliza leant her head against the window pane and sighed. One day, she thought, one of these days. She was destined for more than her mother wanted for her. \nMrs Banes, Eliza\u2019s mother, desired exactly what Katy had for Eliza. A rich, titled husband, a nice, palatial estate, and a growing litter of little aristocrats.\nAs much as she loved her sister, Eliza would rather throw herself from her bedroom window than resign herself to that life without anything coming before it. \nEliza had told her mother as much when she had rejected one of the many proposals, but Mrs Banes had simply scolded her for being dramatic. \nStop being so dramatic, she would say. You are being ridiculous. Get your head out of those books and step into real life. \nEliza's bedroom door was suddenly opened. \n\\\"Eliza!\\\" Mrs Banes said excitedly. \\\"Come quickly. They are early!\\\" \nEliza smiled completely genuinely. Though she would never want Katy's life for herself, that did not mean that Eliza did not long for her every day. They had grown up together, been inseparable from the ages of nine to nineteen. Being parted felt wrong, and when Katy came to stay, all was right.\nEliza scrambled out of her chair and ran out of her bedroom, and past her mother. She was younger, and faster, than Mrs Banes, and she practically flew to the landing that overlooked the entry foyer of their grand manor. \nSure enough, there Katy stood, flanked by her doting husband, and their two gorgeous daughters. Katy had not noticed Eliza yet, and Eliza beamed with pride as she watched Katy direct the servants with their trunks while she removed little Lizzie's travelling cloak. \nShe held herself differently now. Katy had always been so small before. Of course, she had not grown much in stature, but in poise. She held herself with confidence, as though she belonged, which was something that Eliza knew she had not felt for many, many years. \n\\\"Katy!\\\" cried Eliza as she resumed her race and nearly stumbled down the grand staircase to her sister. \nKaty exclaimed in delight as Harry knowingly reached for Lizzie so that the two girls could greet each other properly. Eliza flew into Katy's arms and squeezed her ever so tightly. \nIt had been months since they had last been together.\n\n\\\"I have missed you!\\\" Katy said, hugging Eliza. \nNot nearly as much as Eliza had missed her. \nKaty pulled away and inspected Eliza's face. \\\"Are you well? Are you alright?\\\" \nKaty's large, pale blue eyes hid nothing. Eliza could see that she was fretting about Eliza, and perhaps rightly so. But there was not much that she could do about it. \\\"Yes,\\\" she replied, \\\"I am well.\\\" She was healthy, and so it was not a lie. \nMrs Banes had reached the foyer, and so commanded Katy's attention. Katy swiftly went to hug her, and Eliza was greeted by Harry. \nIt seemed an age now, that her mother had intended Harry for her. To think that he could have wed anyone other that Katy now seemed absurd. She had never before seen a more devoted husband, not even her own father. But, she concluded, nobody else could have deserved him save for Katy. \n\\\"How are you, Eliza?\\\" Harry asked, leaning down to kiss her cheek in greeting. \n\\\"Well,\\\" she replied. \\\"How was your journey?\\\" \nHe exhaled a laugh. \\\"Have you ever travelled with children?\\\" he asked her. \n\\\"No.\\\" \n\n\n\n"}

That's probably not much comfort to them as they're plummeting to their death. \nI'm not scared of flying. But I can't help thinking about that one person. The person who does drown, or gets hit by a car, or dies in a plane crash. \nLet's just say that planes make me uneasy. I just don't really understand how they work\u2014I know that the air resistance pushing under the wings lifts it up\u2014but it doesn't seem logical. Planes are so big, so heavy. It just doesn't make sense to me. \nI don't like things that don't make sense to me. \nIt's also not much of a comfort to me currently, gripping the armrests tightly as the plane I'm on goes through another bout of turbulence. I've been on this plane for about five hours, and we're less than twenty minutes from touchdown. \nNo way did I get any sleep, with the anxiety pooling in the pit of my stomach. My entire life is changing, and it will be at least a year before I go home again. Before I see my parents, which is a little sad, even if I am excited to be gone. \nI never imagined attending boarding school. I mean, we never had the money. Winning a full-ride scholarship to one of the most prestigious boarding schools in the world was one of my wildest dreams, and now, somehow, it's come true. \nThe Sir Richardson Academy for the Gifted is unusual in both its location and attendees. The kids of the rich and famous, celebrities and royals alike. As long as you've got a ton of money (like hide-the-bodies kind of money) and the prestige to go along with it, your child is in. Most of them are legacies, anyway, third, fourth, or even fifth-generation students. \nOf course, my family isn't rich, nor are we prestigious. No, every year, Richardson's offers two full-ride scholarships to the peasants. I'm not sure if it's to show how \\\"kind and generous\\\" they are, or to rub how insanely rich they are into the faces of us lowly masses. I suspect it's both. \nAnd this year, I've won one of those scholarships. The academic one. They offer one for athletics, as well, but I am so far from sporty it's almost funny. \nThe plane jolts a little as the wheels hit the runway, and I look out to see the palm trees, heat-soaked pavement, and blue as all heck ocean of Puerto Rico. \nI mentioned the location, right? Because, yeah. A little out of the way for one of the oldest and richest private schools in the world. If you look it up online, Google says that Richardson's is located in England. \nWhich is a lie. It's actually on an Island\u2014and all of the brochures and welcome packages just call it that, the Island, capitalized\u2014somewhere near Puerto Rico. Near enough to take a boat too, anyhow, but too small to have an airport.\n\nWhen I exit the airplane, the heat hits me like a wall. Coming from British Columbia, Canada, I'm about as far as prepared for this heat as someone could be. I'm from the West Coast, otherwise known as the Wet Coast, and we just don't get heat like this there. It's more likely to be raining than anything else. \nIf I remember the instructions in the welcome package correctly (and I have them crushed in my hand because travelling alone makes me nervous) then there will be someone else there to meet me, to drive me to the dock. But\u2014and this is the part I'm really nervous about\u2014there might be other students. \nI might have to talk to someone. \nThe pavement shimmers, and I'm glad that I stuffed my sweater in my carry-on bag. \nThe air-conditioning in the airport envelopes me as I head through customs, pick up my one, extremely battered suitcase, and walk towards the large sign titled 'Arrivals'. The doors woosh open, and I'm a little more prepared for the heat this time. I guess I have a year to get used to it. \nMy eyes scan the crowd, and snag on a tall man dressed rather incongruously in a dark suit. He's holding a laminated sign that says 'Sir Richardson Academy' in nearly indecipherable calligraphy. I take a deep breath and tighten my grip on my suitcase. \nTalking to strangers is definitely not my strong suit. \nLuckily, I don't have to say much at all; he takes one look at me, my suitcase and carry-on bag, identification papers clutched tightly in one hand, and nods in greeting. \nI hand him the papers and show him my passport. They told us we would have to do this\u2014security is paramount, remember? All those rich kids make good hostages, I guess. \n\\\"Miss Roberts, this way,\\\" he says, and I don't think he's blinked this whole time. He ushers me towards a black car, and I guess I was wrong about there being other students here, because when he opens the door for me it's empty. \nI climb in, relinquishing my suitcase to the man but keeping a tight grip on my carry-on bag. It's got everything of real import in it, and I don't want to chance losing it. \nEnding up alone in a strange place without any money or a passport or my phone is basically my worst nightmare.\nThe windows are tinted dark enough that even from the inside it's hard to see, but I pull out my phone and follow our little blue dot on Google Maps along the coastline. \nThe man doesn't speak anymore, doesn't introduce himself\u2014he just drives, another bodyguard in the front seat, and me in the back. \nThey both have mics in their ears, and I wonder who they're connected to. I wonder who cares enough about me\u2014one of two token poor kids\u2014to have this set up. \nThis school is insane. \n\n\n\n"}

The serial killer murdered his victims like an artist.\n\n#murder, #mystery, #scary, #moving, #death, #crime, #killer\n\nThe Red Death\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nMy grandmother first told me about The Red Death two years ago.\nShe believed that avoiding the truth was just lying in another form, so she gave me snatches of the story, little by little.\nYoung girls, between sixteen and nineteen. Driving alone. Pulled over, gagged, whisked away, never to be seen alive again. \nAnd, the connecting factor, the reason why she even told me, why it even mattered.\nHe had killed one of them in the woods behind her house. \nThat girl became a buzz in my mind- I guess you could call her an imaginary friend, but even that really doesn't describe it. Her vague outline lives in my head. It's an obsession, sure, but the other option is being completely and utterly alone. So I let her stay. \nI found out more over time, by pestering my grandmother and from my own research, digging myself in deeper and deeper. \nNever caught. No suspects. His name was his modus operandi. He would paint on their skin with a knife, blossoming flowers and twining vines, tear-laden eyes and pursed lips, formed by incisions. He was an artist, but tragically so.\nI never got to visit the house, never got to visit the woods. Grandmother always visited us and never invited us over. She said it was better that way, better for me. I learned to see the house through hints of descriptions, see it as an outline, of materials and furniture. \nBut it won't be like this for much longer.\nGrandmother's funeral was last week.\n\nIt all happened so inconveniently. My father, Dave lost his job. My mother, Katherine had just gotten a citation for her third speeding ticket. When the call came, from a second or third cousin, the waterlogged news, Katherine and Dave sat on the couch together, faces frozen, side by side, but never touching. \nI couldn't bring myself to shed a single tear. I'm like that, I feel the urge to cry, like I should be sobbing, but never do. People die, and my body just doesn't care.\nI was forced to wear a maroon velvet dress to the will-reading, sweaty and sticky and a few sizes too small. Its collar felt like ants crawling along my neckline, the matching fake pearl necklace felt like sharp pebbles strung along my neck.\n We sat in the basement of a church in the next town over, in broken folding chairs with linty seat covers, surrounded by family I had never gotten to know, curvy women in cabled sweaters, toothpick men in droopy fedoras, puffy eyed and sniffling. The lawyer, in his oversized pinstripe suit with glinting cufflinks, didn't look like he belonged, with his blank face.\n But maybe that meant that I didn't belong either.\nThe will poured out like static, woven with legal jargon I didn't understand, accentuated by the lawyer's crackly voice, gravel in his throat. \nI watched the other people comfort each other- hands on knees, held hands, melancholy smiles- but Katherine and Dave just keep staring ahead, expressions unchanging. The three of us stood out so much there, we were the only ones still completely in our own worlds, the only ones whose edges didn't bleed.\nAfter the lawyer had finished, a tray full of stale donuts was passed around, crumbs pooling around the deflated clouds of dough. I bit into one, and it was like my mouth was being stuffed with cotton. As it crawled down my throat, I wrapped up the remains in a yellowed napkin and stuffed it in my purse, never to be seen again. \nAs we exited the church, the clouds rolling in dark sheets over the sky, no one bothered to talk to each other, to engage in conversation, to fill the gaps of years. They were stuck in their own bubbles of grief, isolated and silent. \nMaybe that's why I don't cry. It makes sadness a reality, something concrete and tangible. And when you are sad, you live in the past, oblivious to the world around you slowly dying. \nIn the car, which was like a refrigerator, curiosity crept in and refused to leave. \\\"What even happened?\\\"\nKatherine in the driver's seat, Dave in the passenger's. Rigid against the faux leather.\nDave turned around. \\\"We got what we expected, what we were planning for.\\\"\n\\\"Which is...?\\\"\n\\\"Aurora, we got her house.\\\"\nThe phantom, made of brick and stone. But this wasn't it, there had to be another fold, another reveal.\n\\\"And...?\\\"\n\\\"We're going to be moving there, as soon as possible.\\\"\n\nThe typical reaction to this would be anger, fear, not wanting to leave. But I don't feel that way. I had expected it, with all the turmoil and chaos that had been occurring. And, there isn't anything for me to miss, nothing at all. Our house is run down, cracks lacing the bathroom ceiling, cupboards falling off their hinges, mold crawling through any place with no light. \nThe trees here are beautiful, though. Each autumn, they dissolve into flames, flickers of reds and oranges that flutter to the ground like dead moths. \nBut trees are like that everywhere in New Hampshire, there's nothing special about them.\nThere isn't much to pack, my entire life fits in two boxes. My clothes fit in one, and everything else in the other. A few books, a journal that I hadn't written in in a couple of months. An old watercolor painting I had done, that was supposed to be a field of flowers, but had turned out looking more like rainbow candy had been smashed onto the canvas. Little things, insignificant parts that are somehow sentimental.\nWhen all the boxes have been shoved in the back of the car, stacked precariously on top of each other, I crush myself under a seatbelt. \n\\\"You ready?\\\"\nA fleeting idea passes through my mind. I press the glaring release button of the seatbelt, open the car door, and dash to the porch.\nIt's concrete, uneven slabs smashed together. I fish a purple pen out of my pocket, one of the four I keep in there. I toss it onto the grey flatness, raise my foot, and smash it, the thin plastic shattering like glass. \nThe ink bleeds, staining the concrete.\nI give the house a small, halfhearted wave, then run back to the car, back to my escape.\nAt least one part of me will be here forever.\n\n\n\n"}

Confused whispers. A bright light was shining in his face. Nicholas Flynn was sitting in a chair in some sort of cement room, a group of three animals standing in front of him, each with black armbands on the left sleeve of their grey lab coats. The bands each had a white shield-shaped symbol with a picture of a pink brain and the letters \\\"MG\\\" on either side.\nThe hyena felt very hazy, and his head was aching. He raised his dark hand to hold it, but his other hand came up with him, along with a clinking noise. Looking down revealed that he was handcuffed. Finally, he gathered his words to speak. \\\"Where am I? What is this?\\\"\nOne of the animals, a stocky black and white badger, turned to face a silver fox looking directly at Nick with his arms crossed. \\\"Should I really ask him again?\\\" The badger asked with a concerned face on his muzzle.\nThe fox nodded. \\\"Go ahead.\\\"\nThe badger looked back to Nick, their eyes meeting. \\\"Alrighty. Let's try this again. What do you remember, Nicholas?\\\" The third animal, a brown weasel, held a blue pen to a small clipboard.\nNick blinked blearily. \\\"Did I get arrested for something?\\\"\nThe other animal looked at the fox once more. \\\"Do I have to answer that question every time, Dante?\\\"\n\\\"Just tell him 'no' and be done with it,\\\" Dante responded.\nThe smaller animal nodded. \\\"No, Mr. Flynn. You aren't under arrest. Can you please tell me what you remember before we brought you here?\\\"\nNick scanned his recent memories, immediately finding what these animals were probably looking for. \\\"All I remember is that we were supposed to play a show, but I can't remember anything before getting there.\\\"\n\\\"Right, and do you know who Absalom is?\\\"\nThe hyena swallowed. \\\"You know about that?! He's . . . I mean, I don't exactly know what he is, but I know he's possessing my friend Boris. He's an otter. He plays piano for Water On Fire. That's my band.\\\"\nThe badger's face changed to one of disappointment, and he looked at Dante, yet again, gesticulating wildly as he spoke. \\\"See?! He still remembers! I've done the spell eight times, and nothing is working.\\\"\nDante stroked his chin gently, clicking his tongue. \\\"Uh-huh . . . . Never experienced something like this before.\\\"\nNick shook his head. \\\"I'm sorry, can you guys explain what's going on? Why am I handcuffed?\\\"\n\\\"Since we can't seem to erase your memory of Absalom, I might as well tell you,\\\" the silver fox began, \\\"Your little otter friend, Boris, committed a supernatural crime because he was under the influence of possession.\\\"\nOh, god, Nick thought. \\\"What crime, exactly?\\\"\n\\\"Unfortunately, he murdered your band's manager, Astrid, before the performance began.\\\"\n\\\"What?!\\\" Nick attempted to get out of the seat but quickly realized his legs were cuffed to the chair as well. \\\"What do you mean?!\\\"\n\\\"It's pretty clear what I mean. We're lucky that Boris caused a big scene, or the Mortal Guard wouldn't have been able to come and get you. You were knocked out cold, thanks to him. From the looks of it, you witnessed the murder yourself.\\\"\n\\\"Mortal Guard . . . ? I don't remember seeing anything . . . .\\\" Nick's brows furrowed as he racked his brain for the info.\n\\\"Well, that's because we erased your memories of the events. Though, you seem unable to let go of the knowledge of Absalom for some reason.\\\" Dante tapped his chin, humming after.\n\n\n\\\"Erased my memories? I'm so lost,\\\" Nick responded, his head swimming with the torrents of information that was drenching him. The Mortal Guard, Boris, Astrid. What was going on?\n\\\"I understand. The nurse will explain it in more detail in your room,\\\" Dante said.\n\\\"Room? You're letting me go?\\\"\nA chuckle. \\\"What? Do you think we'd let you go home with the information you retain? No! Of course not! It's far too dangerous. No, you'll be taken to your Resting Room here in the Medical Sect. You'll be staying the night, but we'll have a nurse come in and see how you're doing after a while.\\\"\nNick blinked. \\\". . . Where's Boris now? Did the police arrest him? Or the Mortal Guard or whatever?\\\"\nA defeated look spread across everyone's face. Nick noted the third animal hadn't talked but was writing on the clipboard the entire time. Dante sighed. \\\"We have no idea where he went. And he took your friend Tyler with him. They're both missing.\\\"\nA weight fell upon the hyena's chest. \\\"Wait, really?! Wh-what about Nora and Page?\\\"\n\\\"We've already erased their memories of anything supernatural. They're home and safe now.\\\"\n\\\"And the concert? Was it canceled?\\\"\n\\\"Our Disaster Sect took care of that. Don't worry about it.\\\"\n\\\"What about my parents?\\\" Nick continued. He had a million burning questions, but he knew he couldn't ask them all in one sitting.\n\\\"Don't worry about it,\\\" Dante repeated. \\\"It's all taken care of. You don't need to lift a finger.\\\"\nThe hyena wasn't sure how to gauge the situation, so he simply said, \\\"Okay.\\\"\n\\\"Now, we're going to escort you to your Resting Room. Are you going to resist or go willingly? I ask this because we're going to uncuff your legs.\\\"\nNick looked down at his feet as Dante said this. \\\"I'll cooperate. I have no reason not to. This is just insane, you know. I don't know how to process it.\\\"\n\\\"Well, that's the purpose of the Resting Room. It gives you time to process everything and, as I stated before, have everything be explained to you more clearly. You'll learn about our organization and everything like that there.\\\"\n\\\"Okay,\\\" Nick repeated. \\\"I guess . . .\\\"\nThe fox clapped his black hands together. \\\"Alright! Well, my name is Dante. I'm the leader of Austin Prostasia's Trauma Sect. I'm sure we will see each other again.\\\"\n\\\"You're leaving?\\\"\n\\\"I'm much too busy to carry on here. These two will escort you to your Resting Room.\\\" He pulled out a small silver key from a box that was in his pocket, coming forward and kneeling, unlocking the cuffs on Nick's legs, removing it, and standing back up once he had finished. Nick stayed sitting, waiting for further instructions. The longer the time passed, the more he believed that what was happening was real.\nThe tall silver fox gave him a wave before exiting the room and leaving him with the two other animals. He watched them expectantly. The badger came forward, gesturing for Nick to stand up, which he did. The animal led him out of the room and down the sterile hall.\nThe hyena realized that the place must be massive, judging by the length of the hall and the number of rooms that lined the walls. It seemed to go on forever. It was almost daunting thinking about what the rest of the (What did Dante call it?) Sect looked like. Then there were the strange noises from all around.Nick had been in a hospital similar to this once when he had gotten in a car crash at age eighteen.\n\n\nIt was eerily quiet and cold. Almost like no one was there.\nThis place was much different. There were moaning and yelling and animalistic noises\u2014nurses and doctors shouting at each other, stressfully. At one point, a gurney with squeaky wheels was quickly rolled past the trio, disappearing around the sharp corner. The two animals escorting Nick weren't talking due to the wall of sound filling their ears. Nick hoped they would get to the Resting Room soon. How did anyone work in these extremely loud conditions?\nThey made their way down the hall; left, right, left, left, further.Finally, they arrived at a door with a small black key card scanner next to it. The badger took out a white card and held it against the scanner. The light switched from red to green, and the door opened like something out of a film. The contraption slid upwards instead of swinging forward, despite having a handle.\nThe animals stepped inside, and the men instructed Nick to strip down to his underwear, \\\"put on this gown,\\\" and sit on the bed.A roll of thin paper was lying across the top, and a new white pillow sat on the end. The hyena did so, looking at the other two animals and thinking about how strange of a day it was. He was worried about everything, especially Boris, but his curiosity trumped all else.\n\n\n\n"}

It threatens to crush the air out of me as I drag my feet to the house, one sluggish step after another. The gunshot wound in my leg throbs painfully, torturing me still despite the absence of Haytham's bullet. The bullet that I dug out with my own hands. The bullet that made me a cripple.\nThe door swings open mere seconds after I knock. Madeleine O'Brien is wearing an apron, the white front stained with grease and dirt. The ends of her brown hair are soaked in sweat, curling wildly in the heat. Only then do I realize that I am sweating, too. The feeling almost feels foreign now, after spending months in the merciless cold of the Arctic. Distantly, I hear her utter a few phrases\u2014things like \\\"come inside\\\" and \\\"anything I can help with?\\\".\nI wanted to speak before she did. The words were on the tip of my tongue\u2014the words I steeled myself to utter\u2014but she spoke first. I was, once again, too late.\n\\\"Where's Liam?\\\"\nI watch as Madeleine's blue eyes widen, her mouth opening in a wordless gasp. Her vice-like grip tightens around my forearms, but I barely feel the pain. Her voice is rising now, the words blurring into each other. Everything is out of focus\u2014like a drawing with smeared paint. The only thing I would remember after that moment, as I spoke the words one should never have to speak to another, is the way the light left Madeleine's eyes, as if one had simply pinched two fingers together and snuffed out a candle.\n\\\"Liam's dead.\\\"\nMadeleine staggers back as quickly as if I had punched her. \\\"No... He would never... He can't...\\\"\n\\\"I'm sorry, Madeleine.\\\"\nShe sinks to the ground with a thump, hugging her knees to her chest. She holds her legs in a white-knuckled grip, her fingers digging dangerously into her skirt.\n\\\"If you need my help, I'll be at the Homestead,\\\" I hear myself say, surprised that I was not only capable of uttering words, but a full sentence. I turn to leave then, no longer able to bear the sight of Madeleine slumped on the ground, gazing at the world with unseeing eyes.\nAs I limp through the O'Brien's garden, I hear the sound of light, running footsteps, and the familiar cry of a child.

But it doesn't.\nMy joints crack loudly as I swing my legs over the edge of my bed, finally accepting that sleep will not come\u2014and might never come again. Immediately, pain lances through my right leg, causing pinpoints of black to swim across my vision. Grimacing against the pain, I grip my now very-much needed walking stick and force myself to stand.\nMoonlight steals through the windows, bathing the living room floorboards in silver. I limp across them, casting stark black shadows across the walls along the way, and settle heavily onto one of the few chairs in my living room. The fire in the grate has been reduced to embers, making the room rather chilly.\nI don't know what I'd do in the living room; I don't know what to do with the rest of my life, really. I long to go for a run, for the release I found only in sprinting across rooftops and leaping between trees.\nBut that is a thing of the past.\nI shake my head violently to dispel all thoughts of my old life, then got up to make some tea, mostly to distract myself from falling down the spiral of thoughts. And that is when I hear it\u2014two loud knocks on the front door.\nMy shoulders tense involuntarily, my body still preparing for a fight, though I'm barely capable of one now. Even if anyone did visit the manor before, while it was still home to the Assassins, nobody in their right mind would pay a visit at this hour. Silently as I can, I reach for the crossbow lying on the mantel. The rapping sound comes again; this time more insistent. After notching an arrow, I swing open the door; my fingers steady on the trigger, ready to let the arrow fly. Only, there is no one there.\nWell, no one at eye level, anyway.\n\\\"Mr Davenport.\\\"\nI look down to see a child glaring up at me through steely grey eyes, with all the ferocity of a seven-year old. My heart twists painfully as I recognize her small, thin frame and unruly brown curls. She is Naomi O'Brien, Liam's daughter.\nShe is also alone.\n\\\"Naomi,\\\" I say, trying to keep the alarm out of my voice. I would've knelt down and put my hands on her shoulders, if my leg allowed me to. \\\"What are you doing here? At this hour?\\\"\n\\\"Mam hasn't come home.\\\" Her voice is hard and set\u2014harder than any seven-year old's should've been. With fists curled at her side and small shoulders squared determinedly, she could've been any other child, pouting over a toy she could not have. Only she isn't, because any other child would not have ridden a pony through the thick of the woods in the middle of the night, all without shedding a single tear. \\\"She's been gone for a week.\\\"\n\\\"Do you have any idea where she has gone?\\\"\n\\\"She said she was going to town to buy fresh produce, but she should not have taken so long.\\\" At this, her little eyebrows crease together, as if realizing that her mother had probably been lying to her. I silently thank whatever heavens existed that the O'Brien's home was only a thirty-minute horse-ride away from the Homestead. I don't think I can stand the thought of Naomi travelling alone any longer than that.\n\\\"We're going to find her, Naomi,\\\" I say, hoping my voice sounds more reassuring than I feel. \\\"Why don't you wait inside; I need only a moment to ready the carriage\u2026\\\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

Well, Torren would have killed for that kind of quiet. Especially now, when everything felt so wrong.\nHe felt wrong.\nPerhaps he was overthinking things again, which was possible. A panic attack was nothing more than a sudden onset of thoughts that tore through the human body. Wild as twenty sugar-high children loose inside a laboratory\u2014pushing buttons and mixing chemicals. Torren's anxious thoughts were often irrational, but there was something different about his thoughts tonight. \nIt wasn't that he was scared the odd feeling would kill him.\nHe was scared that whatever was wrong with him had been festering for a long time without his knowledge.\nTorren didn't know how long he had been laying on the gurney, unable to chase away the feeling of wrongness in his chest. He lifted an unsteady hand to his breastbone, expecting to feel a twin pulse hammering away, when a paramedic snapped an oximeter onto his left forefinger and readjusted his oxygen mask.\n\\\"Hold still, my guy,\\\" said a cheeky voice. \\\"You passed out hard. Hit the ground like it did you dirty.\\\"\nA dull memory of his ride back from Ann Arbor took shape in the haze\u2014the flood of swirling blue lights, the buzz of first responders, the orange barricade\u2014and then that strange popping sensation. He had eased his old Civic to the side of the road before approaching a police detective.\n\\\"Have you ever had an experience like that before?\\\"\nThe paramedic's voice helped quiet the storm of thoughts.\n\\\"I pass out sometimes. Anxiety.\\\"\nHis own voice rang foreign from behind the oxygen mask. Muffled and raw.\n\\\"Well, good work falling into the grass. You must be an old pro at this.\\\"\nTorren smiled, grateful for her good humor. He couldn't abide pity, even now. Craning his neck, Torren caught sight of the dilapidated brick house.\nHis new home. Or at least that's what it should have been.\nHe had the impression something terrible had happened. Suddenly, the front door swung open, and an officer appeared on the crumbling cement porch. The cop looked like he might be sick. Nose scrunched, lip curled. He ducked under a line of fresh police tape and joined the group of beat cops conferring in the overgrown yard.\nDread dropped in Torren's stomach like a stack of unread case law. Not that he needed another reminder of how much work his senior year would inevitably bring. Waving the paramedic back over, Torren slid the oxygen mask over his tangle of short, red-brown hair.\n\\\"Can I take this thing off? I'm feeling better.\\\"The paramedic eyed him warily while checking the oximeter. \\\"Alright, but I'd like you to stay on the gurney for a little while longer with your feet elevated. I'm not keen on lifting you up on this thing twice.\\\"\n\\\"Can you tell me what's going on?\\\" Torren searched her face for tells or micro-reactions he could analyze. It was a tactic he learned this summer during his internship at Chambers & Hansen, a law firm in Ann Arbor. He had spent countless hours practicing with the other intern from Eastern Michigan University--Mazia.\nFiling paperwork and other mundane office tasks took on a new light when they worked side-by-side. Mazia was fascinating, and he had so rarely felt fascinated by anyone.\nPulling tight medical gloves off her thick hands, the paramedic studied the matted grass. \n\\\"Well, there's been a suspected homicide at your residence. Detective Wittier wants to ask you a few questions once you're up to it.\\\"\n\n\nTorren stared back at her in disbelief, humidity clinging to his skin like a muslin shroud. \\\"Homicide? But\u2014but that means somebody's dead.\\\"\n\\\"Yes, thank you, Agent Obvious. That's exactly what homicide means.\\\" She set one hand on the curve of her waist and rubbed her forehead with the other. Torren felt the hair on his arms rise, like the air pressure around him had dropped.\nLike a storm was brewing.\nA swirl of ghostly air rustled the bushes and whistled down the empty street. Still, Torren's attention shifted back to the house. It looked broken. Despondent, even. Not just because it was run-down and crooked\u2014which it was\u2014but because the home had let something so horrific happen inside its walls. \nBroken not because of any superficial shortcoming, but from its inability to provide that fundamental purpose of a house\u2014protection.\n\\\"I was just wondering\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Look, I'm not supposed to say anything more\u2014CSI is still sweeping the scene\u2014but between you and me, the Medical Examiner has his work cut out for him. The inside of your living room looks like a scene out of The Jungle. A total slaughterhouse. The worst I've ever seen.\\\"\nTorren blew out a heavy breath. The situation was becoming too real, too fast. Panic wrapped a clammy hand around his throat and squeezed, threatening to plunge him back into unconsciousness. \nLiving with anxiety meant living with panic's hand around your neck and a heavy boot on your chest. Rarely ever alone, even to contemplate your own thoughts, especially when those thoughts took you to a place as grim as death.\nWhere was Mazia? This was her house. Had she heard about the murder? Or...\nPanic shrieked with glee as soon as the thought surfaced. Jockeying his heart into a wild gallop.\nNo.\nTorren wasn't going to entertain the idea that she could be the one inside. He just needed to find her. Maybe this wasn't even the right house. Torren knew panic's only enemy was logic. He just needed to be logical. As if the paramedic could read his thoughts, her dark brown eyes met his, and all her cheeky humor faded.\nHer lips parted\u2014one brown and peaked like toasted meringue and the other a plump, subtle pink\u2014but nothing besides her warm breath came out. Torren propped himself up on his elbows and regretted it immediately. Lights popped against his vision, and a sickening dizziness clouded his thoughts.\n\\\"Settle down, my guy, there's nothing you can do from here. They aren't letting anyone inside the perimeter. It's procedure.\\\" Slipping on a fresh set of gloves, the paramedic eased him into a seated position. \\\"Let me check your heart and your blood pressure again. If everything looks normal, I'll call the detective over. He is adamant about asking you some questions. It's hard to charm stupid, apparently.\\\"\nTorren's vision stabilized while a cold stethoscope was pressed against his chest. \\\"Did you see any of the other tenants? I'm supposed to be meeting my...\\\" He paused, raking a freckly hand through his hair. \nTorren didn't really know what Mazia was to him. A colleague? A friend? Something more? \nLast night, it seemed like Mazia was interested in upgrading their relationship status. The paramedic tilted her head ever so slightly like she was listening in on his internal debate. \nFeeling exposed, Torren quickly said, \\\"a friend. I'm supposed to be meeting my friend. Her name is Mazia Khoury.\\\" \nTorren found himself searching the crowd of people for a group of college students. He didn't know the other roommates exceptionally well but could've picked them out of a line-up just the same.\n\n\nHe listened for Zach's deep baritone. Looked for Austin's straw blonde hair sticking out from that ridiculous cowboy hat. \nThen, with a sudden sense of urgency, Torren began hunting for Davey. He needed to see Davey.

They call it X-32 when they talk like scientists, and Pax when they talk like normal humans. But the public likes naming things in spite of the officials, hence: Planet B.\nA miracle, isn't it.\nMost people didn't believe it, which you really can't blame them for. We lost hope for any renewal ages ago. Earth was completely and utterly fucked, and we're cool with it as long as we're dead by then. So when NASA decided to bust open the door with Pax, we all laughed at them. NASA is legitimate but our chance at revival is most definitely not.\nA new planet? That just so happened to show up? Nice try. \nBut a correct try, since as time went on, people became more and more curious.What seemed like a hoax turned into an opportunity, and an opportunity turned into a prize. \nPictures and news stories and columns starting showing up, and the public was a little more convinced every day. Scientists from all over the world, one by one, began to talk about this new Planet B. By the end of Christmas, we were all wrapped around this idea of a brand new, genuinely inhabitable planet.\nAnd then the government released the long-awaited announcement.\nExam 2632. The Armageddon Experiment.\nForeboding, I know. But even the government liked a good shock factor every now and then.\nTo make the president's speech simple:\nExam 2632\u2014The AE\u2014is a year-long test for every person on the planet who's 12 and older. You get two chips in your neck: One tracks your speech and the other tracks your movement. From January 1st, 2399 to December 31st, 2399, every single thing you say or do is recorded and analyzed. It's a camera in your body for 365 days.\nThe point? See if you're a decent enough person to not ruin our next planet.\nNow, I'm all for a good science experiment. I love science class. I never get better sleep than those one and half hours. But I sure as hell don't like being the guinea pig in said experiment. \nNonetheless, for once in all of history, the people didn't complain. Most people, at least. Everyone here is desperate to get a new life away from the dying place that is Earth. So they got in their lines, readied their lives, and took the chance. Be on their best behavior as long as they could, and they would have a one-way ticket to Pax.\nSounds awesome, right? The great makeover of humanity, waiting to happen, and you could be the next brush used for it.\nThere's a downside, though.\nThink of your daily life. Think of what you do in a day. How saintly is your day to day routine?\nExactly my point. Even Peace Corps members need to sin a little. We all do, it's the basis of our everyday lives. We're not all Jesus or something.\n\n\nI didn't get the chips because I'm so desperate to prove I'm a good person. Like everyone else, I just want to get the hell out of here. But unlike everyone else, I'm really not into the work for it.\nBeing a good person requires way more effort than being a shitty one. You have to keep your ears perked up for any opportunity of a good deed, never get attached to anything because you're always going to give it up anyway, and always have extra coins to lend to some poor soul on the street.\nThat requires attention I have no energy to give. Does that make me a bad person? \nMaybe. \nFrankly, I never bothered to think about it. It's Earth. It's America. Who thinks about anything?\nI have nothing against the AE other than the fact that I can't even go to the bathroom without being very much aware there is some stranger in a lab coat\u2014maybe two\u2014that are listening in. I can't sleep without remembering that same stranger is taking tallies of every one of my breaths and deeming it sinful or heavenly.\nI'm on the verge of insanity, and it's only my third week.\nI figured I'd better off being burned alive by the ultraviolet rays, or drowning in a tsunami, or inhaling too much smog, or drinking polluted water, or God knows what else is going to hell in our world right now.\nBut you get the point.\nWe had one year to get our shit together. One year to get off our ass and do something worth the trip to a new start. One year to get to the top, or die from the fall.\nBut that's being a bit melodramatic, if I do have to admit.\nIt was Friday morning, and I got situated in astronomy class. I was a mechanical engineer major, and yet I sat here learning about thing that I was fairly sure did not relate to said subject. But what did I know? Required classes were required classes. \nI figured the schools did it in some fleeting hope that a revolutionary mind would come up with the cure for the end of the world while dissecting squids or studying floating rocks. Which would have been completely senseless in any other country except this one.\nAmerica was never known for its stellar logic, I suppose.\n341-T was teaching the class today, one of our professor droids with a newer model and a kind opal necklace gifted to her by her makers that elicited her nickname from me of Miss Opal. I thought it creative, but it mostly made her look at me with blank exhaustion. Newer models and their upgraded emotional expression. I never asked to be \n\\\"Please go to your textbooks, page 45,\\\" she said. Her voice still had an air of electronic waves to them.\nI tapped the screen in front of me and pressed the book icon on the far right. \nI went to the instructed page but didn't bother reading. I never bothered doing much of anything. My brother told me that was because I was lazy, but I argue that I just have a mind built to focus on matters more important than college astronomy. Like anything but college astronomy.\nHe hit my shoulder. I told him he was probably the reason I couldn't focus since all that hitting was making me losing brain cells.\n\n\\\"Look what the cat dragged in.\\\"\nI glanced up.\nGenevieve Moore\u2014G to people she liked\u2014hopped into her seat beside me. Her hair was blue today, the color mask brightly covering the traces of her regular dirty blonde waves. \nShe and I go way back to first grade when I tried to give her one of my paper birds and she ripped it by accident. We may or may not have gotten close by me crying my eyes out over it and her trying to apologize by giving me some jelly bees.\nI was seven. Get off my back.\nShe was studying chemical engineering, but she had to take astronomy for extra credits to add to her total unit points because of a club she had joined. The Ancient Geeks of Useless Factoids.\n(They called themselves the robotics team but I like my name better.)\n\\\"Thank god, you're here,\\\" I said, shaking my head. \\\"You'll never guess what you missed.\\\"\nG looked worried at that. She hated missing information.\n\\\"What?\\\" she asked carefully.\nI leaned in, looked around a bit, then turned back to her. \\\"Nothing.\\\"\nShe shoved me and I nearly fell off the hovering seat. Miss Opal gave me those beady, droid eyes that said she could fry my eyebrows off if she wanted too\u2014in a very literal sense\u2014and I muttered a fast apology under my breath before she got the chance.\n\\\"I'm not amused,\\\" G snapped.\n\\\"Are you ever?\\\"\n\\\"Why do you look like shit?\\\"\n\\\"Why do you look like shit?\\\"\n\\\"Run that by me again?\\\"\nI put my hood over my head and grinned. \\\"Don't be bitter, G.

I cleared my throat. What was it with women and their innate ability to shrink your confidence with a single look? Was it learned? Was it a blessing? \n\\\"Woke up late. I skipped my coffee. Had to eat a sugar stick on the way,\\\" I explained.\n\\\"Unlaced one, right?\\\"\n\\\"Yeah,\\\" I said, unconvincingly.\nMiss Opal tapped her desk loudly. We whipped our heads to her and my hood drooped farther, making black curls fall in front of my eyes. I resisted the urge to blow them out of the way.\n\\\"Since you two are so keen on chatting during our lectures,\\\" she began, sighing and walking with the faint sound of buzzing in each move, \\\"why don't you answer our question for us?\\\" She pointed at me.\n\n\n\n"}

The wheels on my suitcase clunked on the concrete, echoing through the station as I dragged it behind me.\nWhy was I doing this to myself?\nMy tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth as I attempted to swallow. I was parched or stupidly nervous for no reason. Running my free palm over my jeans, I made my way to the kiosk for a bottle of water. That packet of Maltesers would do too. Share size? Pfft, they wouldn't last a minute once I opened them. \nI checked my phone for any missed calls and sat on a bench facing the sparse carpark, keeping my eyes peeled for a red Ford KA. The bag of chocolates rustled as I ripped it open and tucked in. Each piece melted on my tongue as I savoured my bites. The longer I sat there, the longer I had time to think. \nFunny how a year ago, I was in a similar situation but running away from this place. It only felt like yesterday I handed my final A level exam paper in, slipped home before my parents noticed, packed a bag and hopped on the first train out of Hampshire. The note, I stuck on the fridge for my parents, hadn't gone down well and the guilt ate away at me every day. \nWith no set plans and limited funds, I boarded a ferry in Portsmouth as a foot passenger and settled on travelling through France. My original idea, to visit the whole of Europe, came to an abrupt end when I ran out of money. I made it as far as a quaint town in the south of France, found a job to pay for my travels but every penny disappeared as soon as it made its way into my pocket. \nI shouldn't moan. The people were extremely welcoming and the food delicious. Well, apart from all the fish. \nAfter my last phone call with my mother, reminding me how selfish I had been, I agreed to come home. She transferred enough money over for a plane ticket straight back to England and the life I left behind. A weight settled in my gut as I thought back to my old life. Was my remorse from leaving so abruptly worth putting myself through it all again?\n***\nI snapped my head up as a car whizzed round the corner, tyres screeching and cheesy pop music blasting through an open window. Masses of curly blonde hair bobbed as one of my best friends flew out of the car and ran towards me. After the initial dread from coming home, I welcomed the giddiness I felt from seeing one of my friends.\nMy other best friend was still at university, in Cambridge and unaware of my return. \nSian wrapped her arms around me as I stood to meet her and swayed from side to side. \n\\\"You're back. Missed ya, Wilson.\\\" She buried her head in my neck and squeezed. \\\"I'm so glad you're home.\\\"\nI returned her embrace with less force, holding the chocolate packet away from her cream jacket. \\\"I missed you too, Daniels. Hey, you changed your car.\\\" Peering over her shoulder, I took in the flash blue car she arrived in. \nSian turned towards it and sighed. \\\"Not mine. My car broke down just as I was leaving work. Luckily, I know a good mechanic and they lent me a car. I would have rung to warn you I was running late but I am always late,\\\" she laughed, hauling my suitcase into the boot. \n\\\"New flavour of the month? I don't know many mechanics who would lend out cars that quickly or take yours in so fast.\\\"\nSian blushed and slammed her door. \\\"Err, no. Just a friend.\\\"\n\\\"It's not like you to go all shy about your sex life. I would say love life but hey, it's you,\\\" I teased as I settled into the passenger seat. She was hiding something. I suspected she had a new man in her life but never dared bring it up.\n\n\nI scraped my nails through my thick hair, combing some knots out and securing it into a high ponytail with the hair tie from my wrist. Some loose, chestnut brown strands escaped from the sides so I tucked them behind my ears and hoped I didn't look as dishevelled as I felt. \n\\\"Yeah, you know me.\\\" Forcing a hollow laugh out, she veered onto the road to take me home. \\\"Talking of sex lives, did you finally give it up to that fine French boy, dying to get into your knickers?\\\"\nMy nose crinkled. \\\"Etienne? God, no! He was so sleazy. Hot, but whoa, was he full-on and as dense as a brick. Honestly, he needed to not speak and he would have been perfect. Just a few words in his sexy French accent would have suited me but no, he had to go all caveman and ruined it. What a turnoff.\\\" \nSian burst out laughing. \\\"It's 'thick as a brick' not 'dense as a brick'! Glad some things never change and you still get your sayings all mixed up.\\\"\n\\\"Pretty sure you understood my point and that you can say both,\\\" I snapped, sinking further into my seat. \n\\\"By the way, have you told Alec you're home yet? He is back and I think you should tell him you are too before someone else does. I don't like keeping him out of the loop.\\\"\nMy heart sank as Sian mentioned my friend's name. I felt dreadful for leaving him behind when he was my rock after my breakup with Max. Ashamed, I kept our contact to a minimum the past year, and he did the same. We messaged every so often and were active on each other's social media, but that was as far as it went. \nIt was easier that way. I knew if I let myself think about him too much, I wouldn't have lasted the year. But God, did I miss him. Sure, Sian and I were close, but what Alec and I had was different. When everything around was falling apart, he was my one constant. It was only a matter of time before he left me behind. I was merely speeding up the inevitable.\nI couldn't hold him back, and I needed to see if I could cope without him as my safety net.\n\\\"Let me have today before everyone else finds out I'm here. If Alec is home, he will be with Max and their friends and, well\u2013\\\" I chewed on my nails, gazing out at the passing countryside\u2013, \\\"it doesn't matter, anyway,\\\" I trailed off. \n\\\"You know Max and Joana broke up. He is very much single, not that I am encouraging you to go after him. That bloke is a massive bell-e\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Don't finish that sentence. He didn't lie to me. He never pretended we had a committed relationship. I just assumed when in fact we weren't that serious,\\\" I mumbled, shame prickling my scalp.\n\\\"Here you go again, defending that prick. He used you, cheated on you, and then made you feel guilty about it. He might have the ability to charm the pants off anyone, but that doesn't give him the right to go ahead with it. Especially while he is with my best friend.\\\"\nThey say time heals all wounds but hearing his name again resurfaced some pain buried deep down inside. Max Reed broke my heart and was one reason I left this place. With his reputation, I had heard about him and seen him around. After all, we lived in a smallish Hampshire village and most of us were born and raised here. \nA few years older than me, he never paid me any attention until Sian and myself started going to our local Pub. Just shy of eighteen, legally I couldn't drink but my friends were already of age. Never one to miss out, I tagged along and got them to buy my drinks. Gerry behind the bar turned a blind eye, confident I wouldn't do anything to get caught by my father, a regular of The Crown Pub.\nWith nothing else to do in this dead-end village, Max and his friends hung around the pub and we spent more and more time together. When you lived in such a close-knit community, it was better to all stick together. His friends invited us to their parties and quickly, Max took a liking to me. He flirted like there was no tomorrow and I couldn't help being flattered. He wasn't your typical stud. What he lacked in looks, he made up for in charisma. Don't get me wrong, he was far from ugly. \n\n\n\n"}

He was wearing a grey suit with a white dress shirt beneath it, unbuttoned at the very top, with his blond hair slicked back neatly. \\\"Now that you're finally legal, I mean.\\\"\n\\\"Sure,\\\" I said. \\\"Um, you pick something for us.\\\"\nIt was my 21st birthday, and we were at one of the swankiest restaurants in the entire city. I barely ever drank, and I definitely didn't know what to order at a place like this.\nAs the only child of two well-to-do lawyers from Chicago, Luke grew up dining at places like this every weekend. As for me, the youngest of four children born to a nurse and schoolteacher from a suburb outside Minneapolis, not so much. My family's idea of a big night out was hitting Applebee's once a month, and even that had to be worked into the budget.\nHe nodded, reaching for the wine list. \\\"I'll get us a bottle of wine.\\\"\nLuke flipped through the pages, looking over the wine selection with the intensity of someone purchasing a new car while I fidgeted in my seat, wishing I hadn't borrowed Amelia's heels. They were at least half a size too small and pinching my toes like crazy.\n\nPrior to slipping into these torturous shoes, I'd spent the better part of the afternoon putting on makeup and getting ready. My roommates nearly took an eye out trying to help me apply fake lashes; it was a serious ordeal, and one that I vowed never to repeat.\nI crossed my legs and surveyed the restaurant to distract myself, taking in the opulent gold accents and framed artwork lining the walls. The other tables were largely occupied by people at least ten years older than us, all well-dressed and well-groomed. This probably wasn't the type of place I would have chosen myself, given the chance, but Luke had surprised me. It was the thought that counted, right?\nAfter another minute, Luke shut the menu, setting it aside. As if we'd summoned him, our server instantly reappeared. He was astonishingly tall, reed-thin, and looked like he could blow away in a heavy breeze.\n\\\"What can I get you started with this evening?\\\" He gave us a pleasant, bland smile that said he didn't believe we could afford to be here. It was half-true.\n\\\"We'll take a bottle of the River Estates Cabernet Sauvignon,\\\" Luke said, handing him the wine menu.\n\\\"Excellent choice.\\\" The waiter gave us a little bow before turning on his heel and leaving.\nI hoped he would return soon so we could order something to eat. After living on peanut butter sandwiches for a month to afford the little black dress I was wearing, the thought of seeing a loaf of Wonder bread or a jar of Jif ever again made me want to hurl. Now I was ravenously hungry for some real food\u2014though the menu was written entirely in French, which I didn't speak.\nLuke reached across the ivory tablecloth, taking my hand in his. He stroked the back of my hand with his thumb. \\\"So, I've been thinking a lot about after graduation.\\\"\n\\\"Why, do you have news?\\\" Excitement bubbled up in my stomach. I leaned closer, studying his face in the candlelight. \\\"Who does Gavin think will bite?\\\"\nAs captain of Callingwood's D1 hockey team, the Bulldogs, Luke's game had been solid over the last year. A number of NHL teams had showed interest in signing him, which gave him some degree of bargaining power and almost guaranteed he would be going to the league.\nThe big question now was which team he'd sign with. Specifically, which team his sports agent, Gavin Harper, could squeeze the best offer out of.\nHe drew in a breath, flashing me a tense smile. \\\"That's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about, actually.\\\"\nMy stomach fluttered. \\\"Okay.\\\"\nThis was it. We were finally going to make a plan. Long distance would be tough, but I knew we could do it. It was only for a year while I finished college. I could fly to him, he could fly to me, and in the off-season, we could live in the same city. Plus, we could FaceTime every day. Totally doable.\nOur server reappeared, pouring a small amount of ruby wine into each of our glasses and waiting expectantly. Waiting for what, I had no idea. Then I realized we were supposed to sample it, but I didn't know what wine was supposed to taste like in the first place. I waited, watching, while Luke swirled the dark red liquid in his glass and tasted it, then nodded at the waiter in approval. He filled our glasses partway before leaving again.\n\\\"It's looking like it will be Tampa Bay or Dallas,\\\" Luke began.\n\\\"That's great.\\\" I took a sip of my wine, suppressing a grimace. It was astringent, like sour grapes and sadness. People drank this for pleasure? \\\"I know you've been hoping for that.\\\"\n\\\"I have. But...\\\" He trailed off, followed by a heavy pause.\n\\\"What is it?\\\" It was probably a money issue or a disagreement over the terms. Luke wanted a clause in the contract to ensure he'd get playoff time in his first year, but not all teams were willing to agree to that.\n\n\\\"I think we should take a break.\\\"\nMy mouth went dry. \\\"A break?\\\"\nLuke nodded. \\\"You know I'll be leaving soon. Let's not make that harder than it needs to be.\\\"\nI blinked, trying to process what he just said, but my brain kept freezing like a glitchy computer. Error: does not compute.\n\\\"You're not leaving until the end of the school year.\\\"\n\\\"But you knew this was coming... right?\\\" His expression was somewhere between pity and incredulity.\nMy breath snagged, eyes pricking with tears. Of course I didn't. Why would I have poured myself into this sexy, low-cut dress that I couldn't afford, borrowed Amelia's four-inch heels from hell, and put on this much makeup? Hell, I was even wearing lipstick. Lipstick.\nObviously, I thought we were going to be discussing commitment, not coming to an end.\n\\\"Wait.\\\" I frowned, slowly working through the subtext behind what he'd said. \\\"Are you asking for a break, or a breakup?\\\"\nHe hesitated. \\\"The second one, I guess.\\\"\n\\\"You guess?\\\" My voice climbed an octave, drawing the attention of the tables around us. People turned and stared, a few of them glaring. \\\"We've been down this road before, Luke. This time it's going to be permanent.\\\"\nLuke cringed, making a lowering motion with his hands. \\\"Let's not make a scene.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, I'm sorry.\\\" I grabbed my wine, taking an unladylike gulp. It was still gross. Slamming the glass back down, I glared at him.\n\\\"Am I embarrassing you while you break up with me in public on my birthday? Or was that why you did it here, so I couldn't make a scene?\\\" Hot tears welled up in my eyes again. I gritted my teeth, swallowing. Right now, it was easier to be mad than sad.\n\\\"No, it's not\u2014I didn't mean for it to come out like this.\\\" He sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose. \\\"I've been thinking about it for a while and I wanted to be fair to you. I didn't want to lead you on.\\\"\n\\\"Right.\\\" I laughed coldly. The fact that he'd been thinking about it was a handful of salt in a fresh wound. I was wearing lacy underwear beneath this dress, planning to sleep with him later, while he was planning an exit strategy. How could I have been so oblivious?\n\\\"I can't believe you're doing this after you begged me to get back together with you this summer.\\\"\n\\\"But that's just it,\\\" he said. \\\"You know we've been together for a long time. Pretty soon, the league is going to rule my whole life. Where I live, where I play, what I eat, everything. I just need some time to myself.\\\"\n\\\"Uh-huh.\\\" I tried to disguise the waver in my voice. \\\"Time to play the field and hook up with puck bunnies, you mean. Just like the last two times.\\\" During our two other \\\"breaks,\\\" I waited around for him while he slept with at least one other person. He groveled to get me back after both of those incidents and foolishly, I forgave him. I thought he'd actually changed.\n\\\"That's not what this is about.\\\"\n\\\"Okay.\\\" I scoffed, crossing my arms and blinking back tears. There was no way I would let him see me cry. \\\"If it's not that, then what is it? \n\n\n\n"}

It's an afterthought\u2014something to make it seem like he cares when he knows he's being a jerk.\nI shove my phone in my bag and wonder what the \\\"something\\\" keeping him away from my concert is this time. A date with some weed, maybe, or too many beers at rehearsal with his band. He's seventeen like me and too young to buy either of these things himself, but his band's drummer, Luke, is twenty-one, and Luke is Bowie's main supplier. Luke also offers me whatever drugs or booze he has on hand whenever I pop by one of their rehearsals or am backstage with Bowie at a show. I decline every time. My so-called significant other never does.\nBut Bowie's text is readable this time, so he might be sober. If it isn't partying keeping him from my concert tonight, I don't want to think about what is. Or, if recent tabloid rumors turn out to be true, who she is. Endless speculation about Bowie cheating on me has run rampant across social media and the entertainment sites lately, but he claims it's nothing but lies.\nI should know better than to read anything the tabloids put out and that it's a fixture of our lives now, for better or for worse. I'm Cayden Indigo, after all, and Bowie is Bowie Nelson. We're the two hottest teen pop acts out there, and both of us have had back-to-back singles in the top 10 on the charts this year. I try not to pay much attention to the chatter and media swirl, but it gets hard to ignore the thousands of social media shares per minute when both my fans and Bowie's are tagging me.\nSome fans are concerned, and some want me to dump him. Then there's the group of Bowie's followers who can't stand me and are just plain vindictive. Some days it's the bright pink, blue, or purple wigs I wear at shows and in public that bother them. They would probably also find fault with my natural dark brown hair, if they ever saw it. Other days I'm too pale or too tan, too short, or have eyes that appear either too aqua or sea-blue, depending on who's complaining. I have what sometimes seems like a million haters. It's kind of impressive for someone who isn't even old enough to vote yet.\n\\\"Will Bowie be missing in action tonight?\\\" my best friend Sawyer asks. He takes the seat between me and his boyfriend, Carter, his shaggy hair flopping in front of his eyes. Either his bestie radar is pinging, or I made a face at my phone while reading Bowie's message and he saw it.\n\\\"What's the rule for this in your game? Two drinks of water?\\\" It's more sad than funny that Bowie's transgressions are now the basis of a water-drinking game.\n\\\"Three,\\\" he replies, raising his bottle of water to his lips. He takes three gulps. I remove the cap from my water and do the same.\n\\\"I'll be hydrated for my set, anyway.\\\" I examine a strand of hot pink hair from the wig I'm already wearing for tonight's show.\n\\\"Again? It's time to kick that one to the curb, Deni.\\\" Carter puts his phone down and sticks his hand out for Sawyer's water. He also takes three drinks.\nBreaking up with Bowie has crossed my mind more than once lately, but I haven't gone through with it. I came close a couple weeks ago, even practicing what I would say. Then Bowie showed up at my house, surprising me with take-out from my favorite Chinese restaurant, flowers, a plan to watch a rom-com, and apologies for how busy he's been with rehearsals and interviews about his new album.\nThe problem with Bowie is how attentive and charming he is when we're together. The problem with me is I fell for the attention and charm in the moment. I talked myself out of dumping him between that and the thought of dealing with my publicist and some of the people at my record label. None of them have any say in my personal life, but I'm well aware of the millions of dollars riding on Bowie and me right now.\nI signed up to co-headline a summer concert tour with him before he asked me out, back when he was nothing more to me than someone I ran into at record label events and award shows. In hindsight, both of us should have known better than to get involved before we'd be together twenty-four seven on the road. If we break up now, that's a whole lot of awkward for the next couple of months, especially since we're supposed to perform a song together for the encore of each show. \n\\\"Maybe after the tour.\\\" My words lack enthusiasm. Carter frowns, but I don't know if it's in response to me putting off the inevitable, or the reminder that he and Sawyer will be apart for two months. Sawyer is hitting the road with me this summer as the tour's opening act, while Carter is staying in L.A. to shoot a film.\n\\\"Do you really want to be tied to this mess on the road?\\\" Carter asks.\nHe has a point, but all three of us sitting here are aware of reality. Our summer tour sold out stadiums and festivals within minutes of tickets going on sale. Even if I did end things with Bowie right now, we would still be on tour together. I can only hope being on the road and having to travel and perform almost every day will force him to focus. \n\\\"I'll have your back on tour, whatever you decide,\\\" Sawyer assures me.\nHe will, because he always has, since the day we met at our performing arts school. And we'll have a blast together during days off from the tour, hitting up beaches and water parks, or exploring whatever city we're in. It's up to Bowie if he hangs out with us or parties with Luke and the rest of his band.\n\\\"We're ready for you, Cayden.\\\" The sound engineer's voice carries across the room.\n\\\"Looks like I'm up.\\\" I hop out of my chair and make my way on to the stage, happy to pause on the conversation and turn my attention to something else.\nI wait while one of the crew lowers my mic stand and take the opportunity to look out at the club. The scattered chairs that are out now will be put away after sound check, and the empty floor will be packed with concert-goers in just a couple of hours for my one-night-only performance here at The Domino. It's been a while since I've played somewhere that holds less than a few thousand people, and I'm excited for tonight's show. It's the second-last one before the summer tour, here in my hometown of L.A., and I'm looking forward to something smaller and more intimate before the weeks of stadiums, arenas, and festivals ahead. Tonight I'll get to see actual faces in the crowd and connect with some of the fans who have gotten me to where I am. For a few hours, nothing else will matter.\nBowie, and whatever apologies and excuses he has this time, can wait.\n\n\n\n"}

Their interest soon faded. The figure offered nothing worthy of keeping their attention, for that she was grateful. Blending into the background was her life, unseen and not remembered.\nHeavy rain pounded relentlessly, creating a silvery veil behind the person. Lyla walked through the door, letting the heavy wood door slap haphazardly behind her. The figure she cut was tired, morose, weak. Her zest for life was fading. Usually, Lyla was a strong and independent woman, but right now, she was far from what she used to be. She had one goal, and with every passing moment, it was slipping from her grasp.\nHolding hope seemed pointless now. She'd searched for days, finding nothing but dead ends. All she wanted was for life to return to the way it was before this drama, this nightmare. Her stomach turned at the thoughts of what might be, fearing the worst of so many situations. Tears formed, quickly swept away before anyone saw them. \nLyla walked to the bar, watched by the patrons. She had their attention back though not one of them knew why. In the past, Lyla would become tense at the scrutiny. Right now, she had other things that were more concerning. Lyla was not fazed by it, already accustomed to this way of life even if she'd only been doing it for a few days and nights now.\nClearing her throat, Lyla hoped to dislodge the muck that had started to form. It wasn't like her to get sick easily, but then, Lyla rarely spent a night out in the cold, let alone several in a row. The rain was persistent but thankfully leaving soon. That is, if the weather reports were accurate.\n\\\"Hey,\\\" Lyla called out to the barman.\nThe robust figure turned from the fridge that he was stacking, closed the door and walked over. \n\\\"Evening, ma'am. What can I get for you tonight?\\\"\n\\\"Information, if you can.\\\"\nShe pulled out a photo of a girl. The long blond hair sat straight over her shoulders. The smile and bright blue eyes made the image look like she was a happy young woman. A picture of a girl from not so long ago, the way that she used to be, the way that her mother wished that she was. Lyla knew that things had changed, it broke her heart, but she accepted that it was something that she could not alter. All she could do was be patient and give her undying love.\n\\\"Haven't seen her.\\\"\n\\\"I should hope not. She's only sixteen. This is my daughter, and she's missing.\\\"\n\\\"If she's only sixteen, then why are you looking for her in here?\\\"\n\\\"Because she walked this street to get to her father's house. She would have passed this place.\\\"\nThe barman leaned on the counter, barely restraining the heavy sigh.\n\\\"Lady, I get in here at lunchtime, through the back door. I unlock the front door, but I don't set foot out of it. If you want, you can ask the people in this place, but most of these guys don't get in until this hour of the night. I think that ordinarily, you don't let a sweet kid like her roam the streets after dark.\\\"\nLyla shook her head sadly. No, walking the streets at night was dangerous, but life was always dangerous. The night only made it harder to see them.\n\\\"They say that this street has a reputation,\\\" Lyla murmured.\n\\\"Sadly, it is true. It's not called the vampire's walk to attract tourists. You are one devoted mother to be out at this time of the night. That crucifix hanging from your neck is not going to help you.\\\"\nInstinctively, she clutched at the pendant. It was a gift from her parents on the day that she graduated from university. Their hope was that in this pendant, she'd have God's protection. Lyla always wore the pendant, thought of the love that came from her parents through it and felt a warmth that she believed was God's love.\n\n\nOf late, she thought that it was just a stupid trinket that meant nothing. Until she had her daughter back, it was worthless to her. The only reason she wore it was because it was a gift from two people that she loved and missed. Any additional bonus of deflecting the vampire's attention was now shot to pieces.\n\\\"I've seen the bastards wearing them. What time do you think your daughter came past here?\\\"\n\\\"About four o'clock.\\\"\nThe barman grumbled, pulling out a box from underneath the counter. Small but stacked tight with business cards of all the people that had come in here over the years. He knew one that might be able to help the woman, but it was a long shot. Still, he thought that she was desperate enough to try just about anything.\n\\\"Witching hour for the vampires. Not a smart move.\\\"\nHe opened up the box and searched through the cards, finding the one he was after.\n\\\"I don't know if this is going to help you, but I've heard that if you want to find anyone, then this is your man. Being involved with a vampire is dangerous for a human.\\\"\n\\\"Involved?\\\"\nHe stopped, the business card between his fingers as he looked at the worried mother. In his opinion, it was nice that the mother thought that her child was sweet and innocent, but life as a bar owner had shown him that most teenagers tried to push the boundaries on everything. Add vampires into the mix, and it was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\\\"The way that vampires work when it comes to humans is one of two ways. We're either dinner or a play toy. No body suggests one, but their habits suggest another.\\\"\nLyla frowned.\n\\\"I don't understand.\\\"\n\\\"Well, they might be bastards and always stalking humans, but they have what I believe is a code of decency. They don't take minors as play toys and only ever take them for food if there is no other option. Without a body to confirm that she's been fed upon, it's likely that she's somewhere giving a vampire a good time, and yes, I heard you when you said she's sixteen. That means that you've either got a skeevie vampire on your hands or your little girl's doing a whole lot of lying to him.\\\"\nThe bartender flicked his fingers down, holding the card out to Lyla. She took it and offered her gratitude. Then he pulled a retro button phone up and put it onto the top counter.\nAs he turned back to restocking the fridge, Lyla picked up the handset and began pressing the buttons. A hand reached forward and pressed the button down, disconnecting the call.\n\\\"I can get you someone better than a washed-up old hack of a private detective.\\\" the soft, husky voice offered. \nWarily Lyla turned, looking at the man that was far too close to her. The three-day growth shadowed most of his jaw, giving him a dishevelled look. It didn't help that the mousy brown hair looked unbrushed.\n\\\"How do you know what he's like?\\\"\n\\\"Word of mouth, dissatisfied customers. Want to find the kid or not?\\\"\nPutting the phone down, Lyla turned with a frown.\n\\\"Of course I do. What kind of stupid question is that?\\\"\n\\\"The kind that comes from a man that's looking at a woman who is wasting time with utter nonsense. If your daughter has walked the vampire mile, then there's a really good chance that she's alive. The problem is, she's probably found herself one of those skeevies that pretends that the fake id she's offering is valid. You don't know what you're going up against.\\\"\nLyla didn't know if it was worth debating with a total stranger. She also didn't know what credentials this new person had. At least the private detective was in the business of finding people.\n\\\"Tick tock. Time waits for no one.\\\"\n\\\"Fine, but I'm keeping this in case your choice is not as great as you think.\\\"\nHe huffed with amusement and then flicked his head, gesturing for Lyla to follow.\nThe line of the bar ended at the wall, but beyond the arch was another area. It was made for larger groups of people rather than the tables and chairs in the central area. It was darker in this new area, something Lyla was not entirely thrilled about.\nTrepidation hit Lyla as she watched the man sit down in a corner booth. He didn't ask if she was okay with this. He didn't even look back at her. The lean figure looked like he was dressed for a funeral. Chiding thoughts filled Lyla's mind, scolding herself for thinking that this man would attend a funeral in such an outfit. \n\n\n\n"}

Bright lights blinded me as I squinted out at the crowd. They surged towards the stage, crushing each other like a pack of animals in a stampede.\n\\\"Thank you all for coming out tonight!\\\" I yelled into the microphone, panting as I caught my breath.\nSweat coated my back and dripped down my forehead. A familiar dizzying tingle pulsed through my temples, striking in time with the pounding of the drums.\nPlease, not again. Not right now.\n\\\"You've been a fantastic audience!\\\"\nI paced across the stage, holding my hand up to block the burning lights. They exploded like starbursts surrounded by glowing halos, blurring in my double vision. Light reflected off my silver sequined top like I was a damn disco ball. What was I thinking when I threw this outfit on?\nDerek caught my eye as I passed him. His guitar was slung around his neck, and a bead of sweat dripped from his chin. He gave his head a weird little shake like a puppy dog, swinging the sweat out his dark hair.\n\\\"Are you all right?\\\" He mouthed me the words.\nMy heart took a leap towards my throat, and I bit down on my tongue. I did not want him worrying about me. This was not his problem. I could handle it myself. After forcing a half grin, I nodded and turned my attention back to the crowd.\nPush through, Allison. You've got this. Almost there.\nWe'd worked so hard to get here. After so many late nights practicing and playing for near-empty venues as the opening act, fans were finally cheering for us, too. They weren't just waiting for us to get off the stage so the headliner would come on. Tonight, half the audience had screamed out the chorus of our last song with me. Hearing that made me feel like I was on fire. They knew all the lyrics.\nI wasn't going to mess up everything we'd worked for by doing something stupid like freaking out on stage.\n\\\"I hope you all are excited for Make Them Scream!\\\" I ran my shaky hand through my long, straight hair as I gazed out at the audience. I couldn't make out any faces, just a swirling, shouting mass of people. A pang of a headache flared through my temples like a jolt of lightning.\nI need to get out of here.\n\\\"We're Hell Flower, and it's been amazing playing for you!\\\" I screamed into the microphone.\nDerek strummed out a distorted chord that reverberated through the theater, and Sam slammed on the drums, shaking the stage beneath my feet.\n\\\"Goodnight!\\\" I threw my fist into the air, and then without giving the audience or my band a second glance, I jetted off the stage.\nFire burned in my veins. My skin tingled like I was coated in ice. I scratched at my arms, trying to make the itching stop. Hot, humid air churned in my lungs with each deep gasp. The oppressive scents of vomit, sweat and stale beer suffocated me as my senses amplified, my feet pounding against the polished concrete floor in the back hall.\nI need air.\n\\\"Allison!\\\" a voice called as I jogged toward the exit. \\\"Allison! Stop!\\\"\n\\\"I'm fine!\\\" I snapped without looking back.\nA hand grabbed me by the arm, and I yelped. Derek spun me around to face him. His dark eyes were bloodshot but concerned, and his shaggy brown hair was a frizzy mess on top of his head.\n\\\"Allison, what's going on?\\\" he begged. \\\"Talk to me, please.\\\"\nMy legs shook beneath me. His grip on me was light\u2014comforting\u2014but I didn't need him to take care of me. I didn't want him to see me like this. Not again.\n\nA stab of pain jolted through my temples. \\\"I just need air.\\\" I yanked my arm out of his grip and rushed to the door.\n\\\"Just give her some space to cool off.\\\" I heard Sam say to Derek, but I didn't turn back.\nThe flickering red lights of the exit sign spun and pulsed like I was underwater. I slammed both palms into the metal latch, and with a grunting clank, the heavy door swung open.\nA breath of cold air rushed over me, sending my blonde hair flying around my head. A flurry of tiny snowflakes struck my face. They melted immediately on my skin, taking the boiling heat with them.\nBreathe. Breathe.\nI repeated the thought as I paced along the side of the building, running my hand over the cool wall. The large, painted stones were smooth and damp, like they'd been worn away by a waterfall. I traced a finger along a line of faded graffiti, following it like a maze until it became lost beneath a dozen other tags.\nI glanced back over my shoulder to check that Derek hadn't followed. He didn't need to see me like this and start wondering. I hadn't even drank that much before the show this time. I hadn't done this to myself. This wasn't my fault, right?\nNausea clenched at my stomach, making me doubt my own thoughts. What was wrong with me? Why was this happening? It had happened before, but the feeling had never been this intense or sudden. Why was it getting worse?\nI clawed at my arms. My skin itched like something was crawling beneath it. Tears burned behind my eyes, but I refused to cry. I was not just a stupid, emotional girl having a panic attack. I was not going to cry.\nI needed a drink.\nAlcohol would help. A half empty bottle of vodka was stashed under my bunk on our tour bus. I would finish that tonight. I would pass out, and then I'd puke my guts out when I woke up in the morning, and everything would be okay.\nI could fix myself.\nSet on my plan, I stomped across the parking lot toward the bus. The pavement was slick with a thin sheen of snow. I kicked my combat boots through it as the icy wind beat past me. My hands and bare arms burned from the chill, but it was what I needed.\nI'd always loved the cold, ever since I was a child. My parents would have to fight me to get me to put on a jacket, even in a blizzard. My dad called me his Abominable Snowdaughter when I was little. Back when my parents actually spent time with me. Back when they were still alive.\nThat part of my life was long in the dust.\n\\\"Hey, Allison,\\\" a husky voice broke me out of my thoughts, and I jumped.\n\\\"Fuck, you startled me, Blake,\\\" I said as he took a few stumbling steps out of Gen F's tour bus.\n\\\"How'd your set go?\\\" he slurred, leaning back against the side of the bus and smirking. His dyed-red hair was spiked up like a halo of fire. He wasn't wearing a jacket, just a pair of ripped black jeans and a sleeveless shirt that showed off his biceps and recently emerging beer gut. The old-school Jaws graphic with the great white shark was displayed across the front of it.\nHe definitely wasn't dressed for the weather. He'd only gotten off the bus because he saw me coming.\n\\\"Not right now, Blake.\\\" I made sure my voice came out forceful but cool. I didn't want him to see how upset I was.\n\\\"Aw, Ally Cat,\\\" he said.\nI tensed at the nickname I hated, my jaw clenching. The only person I let call me that was my childhood best friend, Carolyn.\n\nBlake pushed himself off of the bus and took a step closer to me. I could feel his hot breath on my skin and the stink of foul liquor and cigarettes.\n\\\"I'm sure you did great.\\\" He flashed me a drunken smile and ran his hand through my hair until it caught in a tangle. A chill rushed down my spine, and I froze.\n\\\"It was a one-time thing, Blake,\\\" I tried to brush him off. I took a step back, but he closed the gap.\n\\\"You can't tell me you didn't enjoy it.\\\" He pouted at me.\n\\\"Yeah, but like I said, one-time thing.\\\" I spaced out the last words for emphasis.\nBlake wasn't a bad lay. I'd done worse, but right now, all I wanted was to get drunk. Drunk enough to make this horrible feeling crawling over my entire body go away. \n\\\"How about just a drink?\\\" Blake flashed me a grin.\nI narrowed my eyes at him. I thought about going back to my tour bus and drinking myself to sleep. Alone.\nThen, my mind wandered to Derek. What was he doing right now? Probably getting ready to head over to the after party with Sam.\nDerek didn't even like parties that much. If I caught him now, would he stay back on the bus with me? He'd probably insist on teaching me one of the weird board games he'd bought from some random startup, and we'd end up playing Monopoly when I couldn't figure out the rules.\n\n\n\n"}

Silent, like my gender ought to be. They speak my words, weave those sentences into the hymns they recite, but they are my legacy, my stories. I wrote them down. I gave them life.\nMaybe it is egotistical to claim words as my own. Why do I feel so possessive of these words spoken among thousands? \nDoes it make me any different from the kings and their soldiers claiming the lands? Men are praised for laying a claim on barren lands, yet a woman's claim on her own thoughts is rapacious. Does my gender not entitle me to my thoughts and desires? Am I to give away all that I have created because I was born a woman?\nI do not wish to lay claim on anything that isn't mine, not a desert plain nor a silken garb. I only want to protect what is mine - that which I have created. Like a mother who wishes to protect her children, I brought these writings into a world that does not seem to understand them, a world that wants to taint and change them into something they were never meant to be. \nSo, I lay my claim on them in order to protect them. Is that so wrong? \nMy father's name is carved in every clay tablet; his words and actions will be remembered for centuries. My brothers follow in his footsteps, having their heroisms immortalized with their names, sons of the mightiest king that ever lived. But my mother, the woman who raised those boys, is but an image standing in my father's shadow. Her name is not carved on any tablet, nor are her deeds remembered. Even her portrait on the palace wall is nameless. Is that to be my fate? To go down in history as a mere image on a wall?\nNo. If the gods choose that path for me, I should feel content with that notion, but I don't. The gods granted me too much pride to be satisfied with a measly image. I will carve my name on the tablets myself. Immortalize my story, my opinion, my thoughts. After my spirit has left this realm, and they have given my body back to the earth, my name will still be remembered. \nI will make sure of it. \nThe idea alone gives me a strength I never thought I would possess. Who would have thought that being able to carve one's place in history would be so exhilarating? Perhaps people centuries from now will read my writings and speak my name. \nWhat will they say about me?\nWhat will they think about the first woman-no-the first human who claimed the words she wrote as her own? \n\nChapter 2\n\nIt was utterly still within the palace walls, as if even the gods held their breath. The curtains hang straight and silent. If I was be able to feel the beating of a birds' wings - that would have been the only breeze.\nUsually, I would pray for this silence, but now the eerie absence of the sounds of boys running through the corridors, their voices bouncing off the walls, filled me with dread. So, instead of being soothed, my senses became heightened. Searching for any sound. Any confirmation that my brothers were still alive.\nWhen at last, my ears picked up the silent humming from the garden, my heart stopped for a moment. Following the sound, that was barely louder than a whisper, I found myself on the edge of the oasis that was the garden. The sandstone gate was as big as a cow, and ivy cascaded over the fence, growing tendrils in every direction. Sitting there, below the ivy, mother's figure was slumped over. Her slender fingers brushed the raven locks of Ibarum as the toddler lay snuggled up on her lap, for which he had grown too big. \nMother looked up and smiled the same way she always did. The lines on her golden skin were edged with worry. Swollen eyes, and dark circles scarring the face that was once known as the most beautiful in the world. \\\"Did you pray?\\\" She asked.\n\\\"All I do these days is pray. I'm certain the gods will strike me down, and make me mute if I continue.\\\"\nMother's smile fell into a thin line, \\\"but there is nothing else we can do.\\\"\nI wanted to counter her statement. Prove her wrong by saying we could do something else. We could pick up a sword, we could ride out into the desert, we could defeat our enemies in battle. \\\"Can't we go outside. Perhaps if we scout beyond the walls of Akkad-\\\"\n\\\"Don't start. Not now. I have enough on my mind without your wild escapades. It is a truth as clear as the sun rising in the east that men were made for battle.\\\" \n\\\"I said nothing about joining the battle. But we could at least attempt to look for them.\\\" \n\\\"No, I'm not having this discussion with you again. You are a princess and you will stay here in the palace where we can keep you safe.\\\" she sighed as if the weight of the world rested on her shoulders, \\\"maybe we should pray to Inanna that she will bring shift news.\\\"\nAs I sat down beside mother, I could feel her fear press down upon me. \\\"It will be alright, mother. Soon a falcon will fly in with news from father.\\\"\n\\\"Your father has never sent his falcon to deliver good news,\\\" mother whispered, stroking her son's hair as if it was the only thing keeping her sane. \n\\\"Ibarum looks more like father with each passing day.\\\"\nA small smile lined mother's lips. \\\"He does, doesn't he? I only pray he doesn't have Sargon's insatiable hunger for power.\\\" \nMother's eyes drifted away as her word sank in. Father's conquests had been numerous. The amount was even called legendary among the guards. But I knew little about them. Every conquest was just another instance where father rode off with his army for several months and returned with the news that our kingdom had become even greater, somehow. As a child, I often rode after him on my mare, wanting to join him. Only to be stopped by the wet-nurses or other. Up till now, it had never occurred to me that each time he rode out of the city walls, there was a chance he might never return. And if he never returned, what would become of us? Glancing at mother's face as it fell to worry, I wondered how many sleepless nights that question had plagued her. \n\\\"Rimush and Manishtushu are with him. They will want to return to Akkad as soon as they find out the desert does not supply them with their daily dose of honeyed figs and wine.\\\" I said, hoping to lift her spirits, if only for a moment.\n\n\n\n"}

Disappointed. A little bored, maybe.\nWhy do we do things? Because we must? Because we can? Because, if you ask any teenager, 'I don't know?' Or, just because? I crossed the road because, unlike the hedgehog who wanted to see his flat mate, I needed to. I ate the milk chocolate Hob-Nob biscuit because I wanted to. I killed her just because.\nNo, there's always a reason, isn't there? 'Just because' doesn't cut it. It's a cop out. Maybe the reason is something elusive. Something you can't put into words, but it's still there. So, I slid the knife across her throat, because I wanted to know if I could. If I'd like it or if I'd be disgusted and horrified. I'd taken a life. I'd been covered in blood. She'd farted in fright just before she fell.\nI expected her death to be graceful. She would slide to the floor as her soul hissed at me, drifting to the hereafter but wishing it could linger within its body to protect it from anything else I might inflict upon her. I hadn't planned on doing anything to the woman either before or after I killed her. I am not a rapist and nor am I a necrophiliac. I'm not deranged or a monster, just curious. Grace had abandoned her, though. She farted, gurgled and dropped.\nShe was pretty. Extremely so. I thought she deserved more than that. Not that beauty gave her the right to anything more than she had, but it just seemed fitting that she should have been more elegant in dying. So, I also felt cheated. Perhaps it was deliberate. She refused to give me what I wanted in defiance for me murdering her. In that case, maybe I deserved it.\nMurder. I suppose that's what it was, though it didn't feel like it. it just felt as if I was trying something out. I was ticking something off a bucket list that I didn't realise I had. Northern Lights? Done. Valley of the Kings? Yup. Skydiving? Pretty much, though it was indoor because of a niggling, shitty little heart defect. Still, I can tick it off.\nMurder? Sorted.\nExcept, it wasn't what I wanted. It was like the stencil of a tattoo, applied to the skin before the artist picks up their needles. It was waiting to be filled in. Waiting for the pain to make it real rather than a hint of what it could be.\nSo, perhaps next time I might be fulfilled.\nI did quite like it. I can't say I enjoyed it because it left a gap in my expectations, but it wasn't an unpleasant experience. Unless you were the woman, of course. I doubt it was one of the best moments of her life. Although I did see her in a play recently at the local Theatre. It was meant to be a raunchy Roman comedy and was talky and political. The funniest thing was when the man in front of me, who was complaining loudly, accidentally spilled his red wine over his white jumper. She wasn't particularly good, so I suppose you could say she died in that.\nSo at least this time it was less painful. For her, anyway.\nIt was coincidence that I'd already met her. Part of me wanted to check the cast list of the play to find out who she was, but then I'd know her. Then there'd be a connection. I didn't want that. Her name didn't matter. She was serving a purpose. It wasn't her fault that it didn't quite work out. She could hardly come back to life to let me kill her again, and again and again, to get it right. Perhaps it was the fact that I'd recognised her that reduced the effect.\nI wasn't sorry. Why should I be? She was a bad actress in a cheap play. She lived above a massage parlour that was, in reality, a brothel. She had better \u2013 and more - teeth than any of the 'ladies' that frequented the shady establishment, and she should have worked harder to achieve her potential. I was saving her and she repaid me by diminishing her death. She fell. She broke wind.\nNo, she couldn't help it.\nI walked away, trying to put my disappointment to one side and telling myself that she wasn't to blame. Things just happen. Just because.\nBut, maybe she was saving that fart for me.\nI threw the knife away, into the river she'd been walking over. I wasn't exactly disposing of evidence, it had simply served its purpose, much like her. I didn't need it anymore. For the next one, I'd use something else. I'd seen enough episodes of Criminal Minds and other such shows to know you can murder someone with practically anything.\nIf I was planning on killing again, which it seemed clear I was, I supposed that made me some sort of serial killer. I wasn't sure how I felt about that. There was a distinct flavour of trepidation, but it was tinged with the taste of excitement. I wanted to play it down and just treat it as an experiment, one that needed trying again. But it was thrilling!\nBut, remain calm. I had to remain calm. If I didn't, I'd be caught.\nOn almost all the police shows and films, the killer had an M.O. A Modus Operandi that tied them to each crime scene. They'd always sew the eyes shut because their parents made them watch while having sex. They'd sit them at the dinner table because family was everything and they were brought up with nothing. It was a pattern. A badge. A great neon sign hanging, Damocles-like, over their head. Here I am! This is me!\nAnd, so, they were caught. Hunted down and shot or locked up for the rest of their lives.\nWhy do that? Why embed a clue into your work? Unless you wanted to be caught, I supposed. Some did. Some enjoyed the chase and the knowledge that they're outwitting all those smart, donut loving police officers, until they're not and they're caught. Some wanted to be caught because then the world knew who they are and could celebrate, in the form of notoriety and media coverage, what they've done.\nI didn't want that. I didn't want to be caught and I didn't want my face and name to be splashed over the news and Facebook or have memes made from photos of my incarceration. I wasn't a glory hound. I didn't seek out infamy.\nWould that give me an advantage? There would be nothing ritualistic or repetitive about the deaths I caused, apart from the deaths I caused.\nOh, I was getting ahead of myself. I was using the plural. Deaths. I knew there'd be another one, but that might be the One. That might give me everything I needed. It could be graceful and meaningful and sad and poignant. And I could stop right there and go on with my job and family and life, with the little hole within me filled in.\nThe hole would become whole.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \n\n\n\n"}

Alexander Cavanagh and his best friend Peter Knightley move to Stratton, Vermont. Sophia is going to Stratton for Haley\u2019s Christmas party.\n\n#christmas, #party, #newyork, #holiday, #romance, #holidayromance, #love\n\nThe Holiday\u2019s\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": " \n\nSophia Reymont peered down at the dribble of coffee that had landed on her blazer. \nShe wasn't upset. Instead, she bit her lip to keep from smiling inside the crowded elevator. It matched the stain on the other side. Small enough that no one else would take notice, and the first stain a reminder of the day she met her best friend. \nThe same friend that awaited her when the doors opened. \nHaley Willows tilted her head when she saw the tray in Sophia's hand.\n\\\"You know you don't have to do that anymore,\\\" Haley said, a smile in her voice. \n\\\"It's tradition,\\\" Sophia shrugged, offering the tray to Haley, \\\"and it brings good luck.\\\" \nSophia had been marking important days with a coffee run long before Haley had been her boss at the Inspire Manhattan Marketing Agency. They had both studied at New York University. Haley, a sophomore, was assigned as Sophia's mentor in her freshman year. They had been inseparable ever since. \nA coffee run before an exam or an interview was now one before a pitch meeting. \nThey're ready for us in Meeting Room B,\\\" Haley said, talking a sip. \n\\\"I'll be right there,\\\" Sophia replied. She stopped at her office to take her laptop and files, heading for the glass doors down the hall. \nA man and a woman stood behind Haley's ponytail. They seemed to be the same age as her father. They had began their conversation, but she was greeted with silence when she opened the door. \n\\\"Sophia,\\\" Haley greeted her again. \\\"Meet Joy and Tom Kristoff. Joy, Tom, this is our analyst, Sophia Reymont.\\\"\nShe understood Haley's verbal cue immediately. First names were only introduced if the pitch was warm, otherwise clients were addressed with nouns.\n\\\"Pleasure to meet you, both,\\\" Sophia greeted, shaking hands with the husband and wife. \nShe noticed that Joy was sporting a ring from the couple's own winter collection. As always, she wondered if the product displays were only for the sake of the meeting, or if the woman truly believed in her brand. She focused on the latter for the sake of her presentation.\nIntroductions aside, Sophia didn't waste any time. She pitched her research and ideas, encouraged by the clients nodding their heads with each of her statements.\n\\\"So, you see,\\\" she concluded, \\\"it's not the holiday season that buyers are emulating with their purchases. It's the fact that there's an optimistic event on the horizon, with the convenience of having friends and family already gathered. It's the perfect time to campaign your new line of engagement rings.\\\"\n\\\"Thank you, Sophia,\\\" Haley said, turning to Joy and Tom. \\\"Should we discuss any questions?\\\"\nThe couple didn't waste any time either. \n\\\"What makes you so quick to dismiss the using the idea of the holidays as a marketing tool?\\\" Tom asked, leaning forward across the conference table.\n\\\"I wouldn't dismiss the splendor of the holiday season,\\\" Sophia said. \\\"But I think we should focus on evoking the subconscious feelings, targeting those that are planning to get married but haven't thought of it as a real option.\\\"\n\\\"How do you suggest that?\\\" Joy chimed in. \n\\\"We introduce the themes of the season, the warmth and the happiness. The time spent with family and friends. But we don't need to suggest the holiday season outright. We'll be lost in a sea of advertisements. We need to distinguish ourselves as a class apart. Not campaigning because it's a convenient time for the seller, but for the buyer.\\\"\nShe saw Tom and Joy exchange a look, and she could see Haley hold her breath from the corner of her eye. Joy gave a subtle nod of her head, and they turned back to her.\n\\\"We like you,\\\" Joy said first, and she saw Haley's shoulders relax before she composed herself once again. \\\"We'd like to run with the campaign you've proposed with a few minor changes.\\\"\n\\\"Of course,\\\" Haley said, quickly. \\\"We're here to accommodate.\\\"\nThe rest of the meeting passed by in a blur until she shook hands again, a verbal agreement to make the contract official. She heard Haley in the background, discussing legalities, before she shut the boardroom door. \n\\\"That was incredible,\\\" Haley said to her, \\\"How did you do that?\\\"\n\\\"I didn't do anything,\\\" Sophia shrugged. \\\"It was the data. People don't want Christmas, they want the feeling it brings.\\\"\n\\\"That's good,\\\" Haley said, holding her finger out, \\\"I need to write that down somewhere.\\\"\nHaley watched her as she gathered her belongings.\n\\\"Hey,\\\" Haley said, touching her arm. \\\"You did well.\\\" \nSophia sighed. \n\\\"I feel like I should be more excited,\\\" Sophia said. \\\"I like what I do but it's too easy just to move from one campaign to the next.\\\" \n\\\"Don't let it get you down, okay?\\\" Haley replied. \\\"Who knows. The next project that comes your way could be exactly what you're looking for.\\\" \n\\\"It could,\\\" Sophia agreed, resolutely. \n\\\"And,\\\" Haley waited until Sophia faced her, \\\"you have my holiday party in Stratton to look forward to this weekend!\\\" \n\\\"Another fabulous tradition,\\\" Sophia couldn't help but lift her spirits. \n\\\"See, there you go,\\\" Haley said. \\\"Now, come on. We've got work to do. Actually before that, can you please put some decorations up in your office? I can help.\\\" \n\\\"You know how I feel about them,\\\"\n\\\"I know,\\\" Haley replied, \\\"holidays aren't your style. But this isn't for you. It's for the clients.\\\" \n\\\"For the clients,\\\" Sophia repeated as her mantra and Haley nodded. \n\\\"Thank you,\\\" Haley said. \nHaley touched the side of her arm again before she left the meeting room and Sophia gathered the rest of her belongings. \nShe stopped at the nameplate beside her office, one of many on the twelfth floor. \nSophia Reymont, Marketing Research Analyst. \nA red flowered was perched on top of the plate, mirroring the others in the building. She ran her fingers along her name.\nShe looked around the office, unhurried for the first time. Each of the offices in the IM were decorated with their own Christmas-themed decorations. Some in visions of silver and gold, others in the traditional red and green.\nShe walked into her own space, still bare, trying to focus on IM's new clients.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAlexander Cavanagh scrolled through his emails, periodically checking to see if his flight to Vermont would be delayed because of the weather. \nIt was still sunny in Seattle, a miracle in itself, but a quick Google search had told him Stratton was always facing a storm during this time of year. The first storm of the season had already landed the day before.\n\\\"Boarding for Flight AH 237 to Vermont is now open,\\\" the flight attendant spoke over the speakers. He had been first in line already and was passing through the gates when the other passengers formed a small line.\nAlex briefly wondered if he had the made the right decision, buying a land in a small town that didn't offer much locally, but his instincts had never failed him before. There was no doubt this town drew him. \nHe had bought his home a few days ago as a convenient and private place to stay during his few weeks in town, and for later visits, though he was beginning to think that he would be returning even after the renovations and new construction. It was easy to imagine himself looking out through the window at the falling snow while working from the study. \nHis closest friend and home caretaker, Peter Knightley, took a seat in first class beside him.\n\\\"I apologize, I found myself waiting in the washroom queue.\\\" Peter started. \\\"There are quite a few families on their way to Florida.\\\"\nAlex considered the hot weather and sunshine, but didn't find the appeal. He loved snow during the holiday season. It was a reminder that Christmas was coming, even if he couldn't find time to celebrate. He wondered if that would change this year. There would be no partners or clients vying for his time in the small town. Maybe this would be the year he would finally get his wish. \nHe smiled at Peter.\n\\\"As long as you're here,\\\" Alex replied. \nThe flight, with only a few families on board, took off a few moments later. They landed in an airport two hours outside Stratton, Vermont. \nAlex, having already meticulously planned their arrival, bought a car from a dealership in the city. They'd been willing to drive to the airport for a fee. Alex found the car, and thanked the salesperson, taking the spot in the passenger seat. Peter drove the two remaining hours to Stratton, while Alex took in the sights, before stopping at their new home at the edge of the small town.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nChristmas Elves: Tor and Samu are Christmas elves. They travel into the Dark Forest on Christmas Eve to follow Piet Mustapukki aka the \u201cblackbuck\u201d. They catch him summoning Halla the evil fairy. \n\n#christmas, #elves, #fantasy, #holiday, #norse, #lapland, #nordic, #Christmas\n\nChristmas Elves\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nThe sound of snow crunching under Tor's boots seemed to be filled with a bit of extra magic on this most auspicious of eves. In the otherwise silent night, the crystalline flakes practically chimed in harmony as they compressed under the worn, reindeer-hide soles, leaving a trail of child-sized footprints behind. The frigid air also smelled unusually crisp, tinged with a smattering of smoke that floated toward the starry sky in ghostly plumes from chimneys in the distance.\nThe little man\u2014barely three feet tall or one-and-a-half kyyn\u00e4r\u00e4 as they used to say in these parts before the old ways were forgotten by most\u2014scrambled to duck under low-hanging pine branches and jumped over fallen birch logs. His thick, gray beard caught the gently falling snowflakes, which sparkled every time they reflected the full moon's light. But this was no ordinary midwinter stroll. There was urgency in Tor's steps, and his companion could barely keep up.\n\\\"Why did you drag me out to the woods, tonight of all nights? We should be at home, celebrating with the others,\\\" Samu said, trudging several arm lengths behind. Like Tor, he was a tonttu who grew to below average height and lived to above average length, yet argued with precisely average zeal. \n\\\"Ssh,\\\" Tor shushed, a stumpy, gloved finger covering his frostbitten lips as he glanced back. \\\"You will make our presence known. And I did not drag you,\\\" he added, continuing on his way through the knee-high powder. \\\"In fact, I believe I told you quite clearly to stay behind.\\\"\n\\\"When one of my brothers sneaks away from the Solstice feast before dessert is served, I fear something is amiss,\\\" Samu said, his labored breath creating an ethereal fog around him.\n\\\"The honey cake looked dry, and there was too much nutmeg in the cider.\\\" Tor waved off the concern without as much as giving his fellow Nordic gnome a glance. He knew his brother well enough to guess that under Samu's bulbous nose and surrounded by his snow-white beard, his lips were pursed in a disapproving pout. If the pointy, knit hat on his head\u2014with burgundy stripes instead of emerald, like his own\u2014hadn't practically come down to Samu's eyes, Tor would also no doubt be witness to a set of bushy, white eyebrows pulled together in disfavor.\nBut Samu was not only more advanced in years, but also famously shorter on patience than the situation usually warranted. Not content with letting things be with just a silent scowl and unconvinced by his brother's excuse, the older tonttu grabbed Tor's arm and held him back. \\\"You come here with purpose, yet fear being discovered. Tell me why you've entered the Dark Forest on this most enchanted evening before I call for the rest of our brothers to join us. I'd like to see you continue your secret trek with eleven more pairs of feet in your wake.\\\" \nThe threat certainly wasn't idle, and the last thing Tor needed was more company. He shook his brother's grip off with a spin, and when he faced him again, Tor pushed Samu backward into the snow. The little man landed with a soft thump, sending a cloud of flakes into the air. Jumping on top of him, Tor grabbed the lapel of Samu's thick, felt coat\u2014trimmed with the fur of an Arctic hare\u2014and pulled his face to just inches from his own. \n\\\"You thick skulled\u2014\\\" he began, but Samu lunged up and tossed him aside. He may not have had a chance to finish the scolding, but even while pinned underneath Samu, Tor wasn't going to give up so easily. With their limbs still intertwined, he mustered all his strength to fend off his brother and roll along the forest floor. \nFirst he was up, then he was down. Up again for a moment, underneath again the next. The frozen crystals scattered in a whirlwind around the little men as the two huffed and groaned in their struggle. With their strength and resolve evenly matched, only luck would determine who would end up on top when they finally stopped. And tonight, fortune favored Samu.\n\n\nStraddling the younger tonttu\u2014whose disheveled, gray beard now prevented him from seeing anything at all\u2014Samu reached over to scoop a handful of snow. He already relished rubbing it into his arrogant brother's face, but the sight of an unmistakable mark in the virgin powder made him freeze.\n\\\"Is this why you are here?\\\" Samu whispered, his voice quivering with fear as he eyed the goat's hoof-print deep in the snow. Its pair\u2014because the maker of these walked on two legs, not four\u2014was just a step away.\nTor pushed his brother aside and sat up. \\\"I sensed trouble without knowing its exact cause, but now it's confirmed.\\\" He brushed off his beard, still fearing reprimand or even an order to return home.\n\\\"If Piet Mustapukki is involved\u2014on Yuletide of all nights\u2014it is more than trouble,\\\" Samu grumbled as he stood before holding out his hand to his younger brother. \\\"And I suppose if we are on the right track and have already come so far, we might as well continue on.\\\"\nContent with being taken seriously for once, Tor accepted Samu's help and jumped to his feet. Nodding in agreement, he set out to follow the cloven tracks with Samu directly behind. The tiny duo didn't have to go far. Past a low ridge and inside a perfect circle of tall birches, flames flickered. Tor counted twelve torches surrounding the perimeter. In the center and drenched in an eerie glow, a table carved of solid ice held an ancient tome.\nHe could tell it was old and important both because of its yellowed sheets filled with runic symbols that even he couldn't decipher and also by the veracity with which the man standing before it leafed through its pages. Clad in all black attire\u2014from the slightly curved, shiny horns the size of a man's hand protruding from his tousled blonde hair to the cloven, goat hooves sticking out from underneath his tailored slacks and long, designer pea coat\u2014he scanned the delicate scribbles made in midnight colored ink.\n\\\"He has a book!\\\" Samu exclaimed in a stilted whisper.\nTor held back a laugh. Of all the things to single out in the scene before them, that was probably the most mundane. \\\"When has a book ever struck such fear in you, brother?\\\"\n\\\"It is not the mere possession of a book that worries me. It's the words inside, which could cause mayhem,\\\" Samu said as he crouched behind a large boulder, shielding himself from the evil that was about to happen. Because nothing the creature whose human surname meant \\\"black buck\\\" was doing in the Dark Forest on Solstice eve could be anything less than wicked.\nIn spite of his best intentions, Tor didn't have a chance to continue chiding his brother's foolishness when the man with the book raised his arms to the sky and began to speak. No, not speak. Piet Mustapukki\u2014the outcast from Keskitalvi, a town where happiness reigned year-round and everyone was welcome except him\u2014was chanting in the tongue of the ancients.\nTor gasped. His premonition turned out to be correct after all, but oh, how he wished it weren't so.\n\\\"Odin's beard!\\\" Samu exclaimed, recognizing the archaic words. \\\"He can't be\u2014\\\"\n\\\"Look! Is that the last sheaf of grain from the harvest?\\\" Tor interrupted, pointing to the golden stalks at the edge of the table.\n\\\"There's only one purpose of a summoning spell on Yuletide with that book and grain.\\\"\nSamu didn't need to finish. As Piet the Black Buck's chanting became louder, the wind whipped into the air around him with increased ferocity. The snow it picked up formed into a funnel, which\u2014miraculously and right before the tonttu's eyes\u2014deposited a beautiful young woman clad in robes seemingly made of ice at the other side of the altar.\n\\\"Halla,\\\" the brothers whispered the name of the Nordic frost fairy in unison as she straightened the crystalline crown on her head.\n\\\"You have called, and I have appeared,\\\" she addressed Piet with the type of formal apathy that comes from obligation rather than willingness. \\\"State your wish or inquiry so that we may all return to our feasts. It's not every night that fairies are gifted honey cakes.\\\"\nTor shivered. She knew he and his brother were watching from afar. It was the only explanation for the off-handed, yet direct remark about the treat they had been discussing. \n\n\n\n"}

Abhi's eyes were trained on her, unwilling to allow her to escape to another room. In her head, she went through the events that led up to it.\nHer cousin's wedding had just wrapped up, with people going to lunch or staying to bless the couple. She was helping the bride with her hairdo, since some of the flowers had started to fall out. Reina, the bride, started joking with her.\n\\\"Soon it'll be you,\\\" she'd said, snorting a laugh. \\\"Then you'll have to deal with a thick sari, too much jewelry and endless scriptures.\\\"\nAs Nandini babbled a no, someone pulled on her arm abruptly, ripping her away from her cousin. Abhi dragged her to a side full with Indian Aunties.\nInstantly, she knew something was wrong.\nHis usually calm eyes were darting about, as though he were worried who would see, and he started fiddling with his hands, putting them in his pockets and taking them out. He was also sweating profusely, and she could see sweat stains through his thick Indian kurta, even though the venue was well conditioned.\n\\\"I can't do this anymore,\\\" he started, voice cracking. \\\"I'm sorry, but there's someone else I love.\\\"\nShe had thought it was one of his cruel pranks; he'd done things like this before, saying hurtful, sardonic things, only to say it was a joke and that he loved her. But seeing the nervousness on his face and the scared glances, a drop in her stomach told her otherwise.\n\\\"I only stayed because I knew you'd be hurt.\\\"\nThat can't be true.\nOkay, there he can stop. Because I know that's not true.\nHe had hurt her many times before, playing on her insecurities and getting the most out of her because he knew she was scared of what other people would think if they broke up. Both of their families were well known in the social circles. A sense of relief mixed with embarrassment propagated across her body and she crossed her arms.\nFinally she found her voice, whispering painfully, \\\"I only ask you to be honest with me...how long have you felt like this?\\\"\n\\\"For the past few months. We've gotten serious.\\\"\nI wish you could've just said something,\\\" she said; her voice cracked as tears forced themselves to her eyes. There's nothing I can do if you're in love with someone else.\nSeveral aunties nearby clucked eagerly, and when Nandu glared at them, their eyes darted away, staring intently at a beautiful floral piece.\nPain burned in the back of her throat and tears threatened to come out. Before she could say anything hurtful to him, Nandu walked away, desperately trying not to fall apart in front of her family.\nWhen she found her parents, they were jabbering away with their old friends, laughing at the nearby children's antics. Plates of food were spread across the tables, but for once, she wasn't hungry. The smells now made her nauseous, even though many of them were her favorites.\u00a0All the plates of bhajis, samosas, sambar and naan, as well as the bowls of desserts now made her want to retch.\n\n\nEverything seemed faded, almost as if she were walking in a cloud. When she approached her mom, she had to whisper, because if she spoke louder, she'd burst into tears.\n\\\"Ma, can we talk?\\\" She tugged on the sari her mom wore, garnering looks from everyone at the table.\nNormally her mom wouldn't have come with her, but she must've seen something in Nandu's eyes and got up, leaving without an apology to her group.\nThey were well away from everyone when her mom asked, \\\"What's wrong?\\\"\n\\\"Abhi broke it off. Said he loves someone else. They've been together for some time.\\\" The tears were backing up in her eyes and she pinched herself in an effort to hold them back.\nHer mom emitted a sharp hiss, but Nandu continued, not breaking eye contact with the floor, \\\"I told him if that was what he wanted, then so be it. I-I...People heard though. He did it where others were listening. He's felt like this for some time apparently.\\\"\n\\\"Are you okay with this?\\\" Calm and cool, her mom never showed emotion, even if she did sound horrified for her daughter, and she continued to lead Nandu away from the venue. \nShe wasn't sure if she was okay. Part of her was sad, and heartbroken...but there was a sense of relief that she was sure meant something. After all, no woman who had had her engagement broken off felt relieved.\nShe also felt ashamed, but that stemmed from the fact that everyone in both of their families knew the two were to be married, and standing in a wedding, having to face most of those people, she wasn't sure what to do or say.\nRather, it felt like her heart had been run over for some time, but it still felt at peace. That relief felt like a small sliver of lighting on the darkest nights, when the moon fought to shine through.\nThey were on the other side of the hotel, near a pool when she broke into tears, unable to hold them back from overthinking. Pool goers stared oddly as the younger woman collapsed against the older one, choking on tears, shuddering as the hiccups came, drowning out her apologies.\n\\\"Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't think this would happen, and I don't know what to do now. Everyone's going to be asking questions and I don't have answers and-and what am I supposed to do?\\\"\nHer mom repeated her question, calmly and surely, \\\"Are you okay with this?\\\"\nNandini steadied her breath, trying hard to ignore the unconcealed looks of worry from the people nearby, but failing miserably. \\\"I don't know...I'm sad but I feel relieved. My heart hurts but I also feel ashamed.\\\" Everything had to be the woman's fault. People would blame her, and then other men would find her unattractive because she'd had a broken engagement. It was like rolling down a mountain's slope.\u00a0\nWhen she raised her eyes, she was dumbfounded to find her mom smiling softly, almost sadly. Her eyebrows were twisted up and a painful look had settled in the older woman's eyes.\nHer mom sighed. \\\"I know it's too early to say this...very early. But don't feel ashamed, when you've done nothing wrong. I did have an off feeling about him, considering how controlling he was of you, especially when we were around. And I know you know because I spoke to you about it.\\\"\nNandini blubbered an apology, but her mom was having none of it, continuing with, \\\"It'll be hard, but don't blame yourself. Give it some time to cool down, if you feel he's mistaken then talk to him about it.\\\"\nTruth was, she didn't want to talk to him about it. Something about feeling relieved told her to just leave him alone and let it go.\nIf only it were as easy as that.\n\n\n\nDOWN TO HERE\n\n"}

Instead, she looked like a banana, battered after a long day of typing away at her laptop. \nArticles didn't write themselves, and Kenna's deadline had hung over her head like a guillotine blade while she worked. At least she had submitted it on time.\nTake a breath, Kenna. Nobody said that being in your twenties was easy. One thing at a time.\nShe and Tim had been planning this dinner for months. The thought of it had made her hands fly over her keyboard even though her mind strung words together as clumsy fingers would. \nIt had been too long since they had been out on a proper date. Kenna wanted to make it special, but a banana dress wasn't what she had in mind. \nShe lifted her long red hair off her shoulders with her pale, ink-splotched hands. The yellow figure-hugging dress looked wrong on her slender frame. Simply put, Kenna had very little figure to hug. \nSitting midway up her thighs, the dress was too short for her liking. It was set on its length, bouncing back up whenever she pulled it down. Gloria had said it was 'hot' that day in the market, but it just wasn't Kenna. Still, the dress deserved a fair chance, if only on her best friend's word.\nStraightening up, Kenna smoothed over the yellow fabric. The unsightly creases over her chest disappeared. It was an improvement, but not quite enough to make the leap to daffodil, to beautiful and romantic, the substance of daydreams and love stories. With Kenna's pallor of skin, she'd need nothing less than magic to pull that off in this colour.\nWho was she fooling? There was no way Tim would let her get into his car wearing this. \nHis life was a perfect puzzle of pressed suits, sleek cars and posh accents. Sometimes Kenna felt like the only piece that didn't fit into it. Maybe she was. She had never walked into his office and seen anyone else with her messy bun or notebook of hasty plot outlines. \nTim had gazed at Kenna with starry eyes on their first date almost two years ago, but he didn't look at her like that anymore. He had grinned and shaken his head at her messiness in the beginning, but lately, it only made him snap. \nIt had been weeks since they last spent the night together. Tim came over for a movie and dinner when he was off early from work, but he always had an early morning ahead whenever Kenna asked him to stay over. \nWhat if it's not an early morning that keeps him from me? What if it's something else? \nKenna's mouth went dry at the thought. \nSurely Tim would've said so if something was wrong.\nSometimes Kenna looked up at him when he sat beside her, only to see that his eyes were distant as if his mind was somewhere else. He didn't give her those lingering kisses he used to at first, those ones that made her feel like he was tasting her soul so that he'd remember her forever. Now it was just a peck on her lips before he was out the door and heading back to his flat. \nKenna shook her head. She was probably overthinking again. \nThis wasn't any different from the lull all couples experienced once they had been together a while. The spark they had felt at first had settled into steady, comforting flames\u2014different, but not wrong. Right? \nKenna wasn't sure. She had never been with any other man long enough to know. Only one thing was for certain, and that was that the banana dress had to go.\n\nHuffing out a sigh, Kenna peeled the dress from her body. She should've trusted her gut instead of her best friend's words in the stall that day. \nAlthough well-versed in matters of fashion, Gloria often forgot that different rules applied to those without her generous curves and rich dark skin, a colour Shakespeare might've described as ebony, a sweet complexion. \nGloria had loved the lively yellow of the dress. She'd wear it better too. With that in mind, Kenna discarded the dress on her bed. She'd give it to her friend the next time they had a movie night.\nThat still left Kenna with a problem: what to wear to dinner. She should choose something Tim would like, something elegant and understated that would make him remember why he loved her.\nA queasy feeling rippled through Kenna. Tim did love her, didn't he? He must have said it at least once the whole time they'd been together, even if he had stopped replying to her messages with heart emojis.\nOverthinking was going to be the death of her. \nKenna shrugged off her doubts before they dragged her down to depths she couldn't return from. She could salvage anything with focus, and she had her sights set on her relationship. \nWhatever was wrong, she'd make it right tonight. \nPadding over to her wardrobe, Kenna browsed through the garments hanging inside for something suitable. No, more than suitable. \nBeautiful.\nShe had to show Tim that she was sophisticated enough to be at his side. She had to prove that they could work, even though he was firmly rooted in the 21st century while Kenna floated through history in the wake of the literature she spent her days dreaming about.\nKenna's hand brushed over a lacy fabric. She pulled the dress it belonged to out of her wardrobe. It was emerald, a dark colour that did wonders for her complexion. She pulled it over her head and returned to the mirror.\nThe fitted bodice suited her figure better, as did the layers of dark green chiffon that fell to her knees. Kenna smiled at the fairy staring back at her from the mirror, a creature too ethereal for this world, too dainty to be compared to a fruit or even a flower. \nPerfect. \nTim loved this colour on Kenna because it matched her eyes.\nFrom where it lay on her latest scribbled manuscript, Kenna's phone lit up. \nOut of habit, her mouth curved into a smile when Tim's name appeared on the screen. It turned into a frown when she selected their chat and saw that he had sent her a voice note.\nHe was picking her up for dinner soon. What could he have to say that couldn't wait until then?\nWith a sinking feeling and shaking hands, Kenna pressed the play button.\n\\\"Hello, Kenna.\\\"\nShe couldn't lose herself in Tim's voice, not even when he said her name, dragging out the 'a' in a way nobody else did. She needed to know what he had to say.\n\\\"I'm not going to make it to dinner tonight. I'm really sorry, but something came up.\\\"\nHe paused. Kenna let out a relieved breath.\nHe was cancelling on her. No big deal. She hadn't even put her makeup on yet. \nThey could reschedule. Maybe this time it wouldn't take Tim weeks to find a slot for Kenna in his calendar. \nOn the voice note, Tim took a breath. Kenna went still. \nThere was more? \nShe swallowed her dread and listened as Tim continued. \n\\\"I know things haven't been great with us for a while, and you must know it too. It would be best for us to go our own ways. I've met someone else, Ken... and I've enjoyed our time together, but I can't pretend that this is all I want. Take care of yourself.\\\"\nWith that, the phone went silent. \nKenna fumbled to replay the voice note. \nMaybe a glitch had cut off the rest of Tim's message. This couldn't be all he had to say to Kenna. Not after they had been together for two years. \nBut it was, as the voice note confirmed when Kenna played it again. \nAn awful, sick, choking feeling rose inside her. Her hands stopped working, and her phone clattered to the ground. She didn't care to pick it up to check if the screen was cracked, even to see if Tim had sent any texts after the voice note. \nKenna sank onto her bed. The world lost its colour. Even the vintage flower wallpaper that livened up her bedroom faded. The rumble of the traffic outside her flat disappeared into the empty silence inside her. Nothing existed, not even feelings, and especially not a future with Tim.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nThe Thief: El Peigne is best friends with trouble maker Sandra Duvall. They live in Unifore, a planet far away. They steal a cake from Mr. Cromwell.

I'm going to step on your feet!\\\" Sandra shrieked. \nEl debated screaming back that if she ran any faster, she'd be capable of walking on water. But she didn't have enough breath for it. She was barely able to keep her feet moving. \nHer legs burned under the pressure of having to run through the narrow alleyways of Rijeka, struggling to maintain her pace. Stones in the cobbled streets that stuck out of place over time threatened to trip the girls and get them caught.\n El would have thought that after the amount of times Sandra put her in these situations, she would have had legs of steel. Yet, the moment she heard Mr. Cromwell's bellowing, they turned to the same jelly filling inside the fritter Sandra had stolen. \nThey hurtled past Mrs. Knox, securing her nightwear on the clothesline in the small patch of grass behind her home. From El's side gaze, she caught Mrs. Knox's all too knowing look. By this time tomorrow, the entirety of Rijeka would know about El and Sandra's thievery. It didn't matter that El was just being a good friend. She would still be considered an accomplice to the crime. The girls' shenanigans were old news that managed to be new every day. \nThe thought that passed through El's mind was also old and yet new every day. Mama is going to kill me.\nEl rounded to the left, down an even tighter path, pushing back the throbbing of her head. Despite the sun beating down, the shadows of the stone buildings graciously hid them. It was only when El noticed the glint of a badge that she stopped dead in her tracks. At the end of the path, where the shadows took leave, was an Eadi private on his daily patrol. Students from the Eadi Academy in Bestellen. Sandra crashed into El and a number of curses followed until she found what El was looking at.\nSandra looked at the officer and then at El with a roll of her eyes. \\\"Seriously? The child and his rubber bullets will be nothing compared to Mr. Cromwell's hand imprints on our faces.\\\" They took off again, and as they ran by, Sandra flashed the boy a brilliant, white smile that threw him off guard. \nSandra was right of course. The boy's face was unfamiliar, but his kind wasn't. A couple Eadi were sent to every village in Unifore, but the ones assigned had only been through a few years of training. The Eadi insisted that their younger recruits had \\\"real world experience\\\". Many of them still looked like children, thirteen or fourteen. Other than their little training, they proudly carried a few, non-life-threatening weapons on their belts. This would only be a worry if Rijeka faced any other menace besides Sandra. \nAt the sound of heavy footsteps and Mr. Cromwell's outrage closing in on them, El nervously grabbed hold of her necklace. It was a simple, silver chain with a small spiral pendant. Mrs. Peigne had given it to El when she was born, and she hadn't taken it off since.\nJust a couple more turns, and they would have made it to the safety of Al Peigne Boutique. Then they'd have the money to pay Mr. Cromwell back and all would be forgiven. El hoped. She briefly paused\u2014Sandra nearly toppling over her\u2014before careening sharply to the right.\u00a0\n\\\"Are we almost there?\\\" Sandra yelped, her breath escaping her. \nIn the distance, El caught sight of Mrs. Peigne's store and took a mental sigh of relief. Like every other structure in Rijeka, it was composed of the same unremarkable ashen stone as the street it was built on. However, like many other store owners, Mrs. Peigne had added her own personal touch. Pink-potted lilies hung on either side of the door post and above it was its name painted in white calligraphy. Briar and El had also recently painted a couple of the stones in the shades of a rainbow\u2014which Mrs. Peigne was none too happy about. \n\\\"It's right there!\\\" El gasped, pointing hastily in front of her. \nThey burst through the door and found Mrs. Peigne sitting in her usual wooden rocking chair, stitching up a blue cotton shift. Mrs. Peigne immediately stood from her corner of the room, but El ignored her, running to the ivory desk in the back center.\n\n\n\\\"Sandra Duvall, are you incapable of staying out of trouble?\\\" Mrs. Peigne shouted indignantly. El stifled a smile and rummaged through the drawers for the velvet pouch of money.\nSandra gracefully folded her warm sepia arms and squared her shoulders back. \\\"Mrs. Peigne, did you fail to notice your daughter running with me? For all you know, I'm protecting her! Why must you assume that El can do no wrong?\\\" Mrs. Peigne glared at Sandra, and she quickly conceded. \\\"Okay, yes it was me but\u2014\\\"\n El was almost glad to hear the end of Sandra's piteous excuses when the door flew open. Mr. Cromwell stood at the threshold, out of breath and red in the face. \n\\\"Oh, Mr. Cromwell! What an unexpected surprise!\\\" Sandra exclaimed, clasping her hands under her chin. Sandra never let anyone see fear in those mahogany eyes. Even after fifteen years of friendship, El had trouble distinguishing between her guises. \nEl willed courage into her shaking fingers as she felt through the bottommost drawer and located the small bag. She raised it above her head triumphantly. \\\"I have it! See, Mr. Cromwell! Here you go.\\\" \nEl shuffled over, quickly shifting her eyes to the creaky wooden floorboards, feeling the weight of his angry stare. She held up the copper coins, arms trembling. El knew Mr. Cromwell wouldn't hurt her with Mrs. Peigne in the room, but the head and the heart rarely connected. And El's heart was terrified. He snatched it from her, and his stubby fingers, still caked in flour, brushed against hers. She repressed the instinct to shudder and shuffled behind Mrs. Peigne, who stood in the center of the flower-tiled boutique. \nEl peeked over Mrs. Peigne's shoulder to watch Mr. Cromwell. He finally took a step inside and slammed the door behind him, still flustered and panting in recovery. Mrs. Peigne's face was stern, her mouth pressed into a hard line, watching Mr. Cromwell the same way El was. After a few moments, Mrs. Peigne offered to get Mr. Cromwell a glass of water. Though her words were polite, her pitch was cautious. Mrs. Peigne only used this tone when she was angry or scared. This was rarely, and often because of Briar and El. \nMr. Cromwell shook his head vehemently, \\\"In all my years, I have never\u2014\\\"\nThe door flung open with a violent crack to reveal Eder: hunched over, hands on his knees, and gasping for air. \\\"Father, I promise I'll pay for them with my allowance\u2014\\\" \nHe stood up and moved a hand to his rapidly moving chest, taking in the scene. He glanced between the money Mr. Cromwell held in his tightly curled fist, and Sandra and El cowering behind Mrs. Peigne. \n\\\"Oh,\\\" Eder let out with a nervous laugh. \\\"Well, problem solved then.\\\" He grabbed Mr. Cromwell's arm and tugged him out the open door with a brief nod and small smile at Mrs. Peigne. \\\"All's well that ends well, am I right?\\\"\nEder was the boy who didn't have a backbone until it came to his father. Mr. Cromwell practically worshiped his son's feet. Sandra and El had first noticed Eder in their fifth standard. He'd been sitting with a few other boys in the lunch courtyard, showing off his father's newest creation: a custard-filled sponge cake laced with coconut flakes and dark chocolate shavings. \nEl, what's say we steal that smile along with that cake? Sandra had suggested with a nudge and wicked glance his way.\nBut all it had taken was one look at Eder for El to make a decision. His face was made of gentle lines that still managed to carve him out and highlight the rest of his features. His almond eyes were filled to the brim with liquid gold, and his inky straight hair fell just below his perfectly shaped brows. Even from afar, El noticed his rosy complexion and glass skin, and she didn't hesitate to conclude that he was nothing short of ethereal. She had decided that this kind of beauty should never be disturbed. Sandra, on the other hand, had never made that sort of decision.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nCancer: Jenna Yaeger goes to visit her younger brother Jayson in the hospital. He is dying from cancer. He plays music on his keyboard. He has a bucket list that he has finished. \n\n#cancer, #family, #sad, #death, #destiny, #fiction,\n\nCancer\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nJenna Yaeger didn't recognize the corpse that stared back at her in the mirror.\nIt looked a little bit like herself. It had the same blue eyes, but those eyes looked huge and vacant against her sunken cheeks, and far-too-vibrant against its sun-starved skin. Its shoulder-length red hair also looked like her own, but the corpse's ginger locks looked dull and flat and in desperate need of some tender-loving care.\nMakeup should help, she thought and fumbled through her purse. Her hand trembled a little as she dusted her cheeks with a gentle layer of blush, then proceeded with the eyeliner, shadow and highlight, and lipstick until she looked remotely alive. She couldn't visit Jayson without trying to look her best even though it barely camouflaged the wreck of a woman on the inside\nA man and his young daughter of about seven or eight got onto the elevator with her. Jenna pressed the button for the seventh floor while the dad encouraged the child to press the one labeled \\\"3\\\". Their trip wouldn't take nearly as long as hers. The little girl showed Jenna her gap-toothed smile as the overly-cheerful computer voice announced, \\\"Third floor: maternity.\\\"\n\\\"I'm going to see my new baby sister! Buh-Bye!\\\" \nThe little girl waved as her daddy took her hand and led her out of the cab. Jenna envied her. She longed to see what life looked like at the very beginning of the journey instead of spending so much time with those who suffered as they reached the end. No, Jenna's destination was the cancer ward where the battle had been fought and lost long ago.\n\\\"Hey there, girlfriend!\\\" the forty-one-year-old nurse whose name tag read Molly chirped in a subdued whisper. She'd been one of the caregivers who tended various family members in this ward over the years. Jenna sent her a Christmas card every year. \\\"Aren't you supposed to be at the spa today?\\\"\nJenna shrugged. She was supposed to be doing a lot of things, like having a career, or a husband, or a family, or a life of her own instead of spending most of her time here and hovering like a ghoul watching her brother die. A few days ago, she let both Jayson and Molly talk her into tempting the fates and scheduling a day of selfish pampering. Even though she knew she deserved to be the center of her own universe once in a while, she couldn't ignore the strong pang of guilt that twisted at her heart.\nThen the nightmare jolted her awake early this morning with a suddenness that left her gasping for breath. Her little voice told her she had to be here today, so she canceled her plans.\n\\\"How is he?\\\" Jenna asked.\n\\\"Listen for yourself.\\\"\nAt first Jenna thought Molly referred to the deceptively soothing beeps of the monitors at her station that reminded Jenna her brother wasn't the only person under her care. With a little effort she blocked out those sounds, and in the distance she picked up the slow, methodical plunking of notes on an old-school Casio keyboard.\n\\\"He's been playing that same tune for hours.\\\"\nShe gave a small smile as the musical phrase repeated, only this time with a different ending than the one before. After a moment of silence, it repeated with yet a third variant tacked onto the final bars.\n\\\"He's trying to avoid the B.\\\"\n\\\"Mmm-hmmm,\\\" Nurse Molly grunted. \\\"If he keeps this up, I'll help him find his B and shove that keyboard where the sun doesn't shine.\\\"\nJenna laughed. It may have felt good, but she still felt guilty doing it in this solemn place. Molly would never have been that blunt to a complete stranger, but she was practically family and Jenna knew she only wanted to cheer her up. When Jayson was first admitted to her ward, the doctors wanted him to leave his little Casio keyboard at home. They insisted the music would distract the other patients.\n\n\\\"Distract them from what? Dying?\\\" Molly challenged. \\\"The music would do them some good.\\\"\nThe doctors caved, and the subject never came up again.\nHaving spent months listening to the same tunes herself, Jenna knew how this could drive a person batty. \\\"I'll see what I can do.\\\"\nAlthough Jayson's room wasn't far from the nurse's station, today it could have been farther than Pluto right now. Jenna hated this place. She hated the memories they conjured up of her parents wasting away. She hated seeing Jayson like this. She hated herself most of all for wishing she could set him free while, at the same time, silently praying that he'd never leave her.\nShe took a deep breath and composed the emotional mask she always wore like a piece of armor to disguise her feelings. This isn't me, she reminded herself. I'm playing a character. It's just another performance.\nOnce she had her role set in her mind, she strolled into his room with practiced ease. \\\"Why are you still in bed on a beautiful day like this?\\\"\nJayson stopped his playing. Jenna almost lost what little emotional control seeing him look so skeletal and frail. His nearly transparent skin stretched tightly across his shriveled muscles. Damn the cancer that ate away at his body and turned him into a living corpse.\nHe gave her a pained smile. \\\"What are you doing here? You're supposed to be doing something fun and relaxing.\\\"\n\\\"I already went.\\\"\n\\\"Liar. It's only eleven o'clock in the morning, and you still look like hell.\\\"\n\\\"You should talk.\\\" She winced at how harsh that came out, and she covered her shame by picking up one of the manuscript music pages scattered about his hospital bed. His handwriting had become illegible in recent weeks as his music notes, rests, and key signatures looked like a secret code. The page she held had been erased so many times he'd worn through the paper. \\\"I thought you finished this song.\\\"\n\\\"I don't like it. It wants to end on a B, but no matter how hard I try, I can't avoid the B.\\\"\nWhile some composers preferred certain key signatures over others, Jayson believed one single note on the scale was out to get him. \\\"I hate how it sounds,\\\" he once told her. B-flat was fine, and C sounded okay, but he insisted the one note in between was the biggest mistake in music history. \\\"It sounds tinny and discordant to me.\\\"\nHis bony hand struggled to reach for his tiny Casio keyboard \u2013 the only musical instrument whose weight his frail legs tolerated \u2013 and, using only his index finger, he painfully plunked out the same tune she'd heard earlier with yet another new ending. Jenna couldn't bear to hear more variations. Only the original sounded right to her, even if it ended on that dreaded B. She reached over and gently guided his hand away from the tiny set of keys.\n\\\"It's finished, Jayson. You've completed it.\\\"\nHe shook his head. Tears rolled down his face and pooled in his hollowed cheeks. \\\"It's not perfect. It's the B...\\\"\n\\\"You have to stop,\\\" Jenna insisted. \\\"If you don't stop, your musical will never be performed on stage and its songs played in the country's finest shopping malls.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, god,\\\" he chortled. \\\"The Bucket List turned into Muzak.\\\"\nHis laughter transformed into heavy coughing that sprayed blood onto his hospital gown. Jenna reached for the call button and signaled Nurse Molly.\nAn awkward silence filled the space between them. Over the past several months, The Bucket List had dominated their attention and conversation. Now that Jayson finished it, neither knew what to say. His hand seemed cold and lifeless against her warm skin. She would've transferred some of her life force into him if she could.\n\\\"I want you to promise me something.\\\"\n\\\"Anything.\\\"\n\\\"I want you to do everything that I couldn't.\\\"\n\\\"Don't be silly.\\\" She forced a smile, but her carefully-executed mask slipped and her tears betrayed her. \\\"You'll be out of here any day now. You'll be strong and healthy and...\\\"\n\\\"Now you're being silly. There's only one way I'll be leaving this room.\\\"\n\\\"No!\\\" she snapped, then immediately regretted her tone. \\\"Everything will be fine. You'll see.\\\"\nHis voice quickly lost strength and clarity, \\\"You'll finally be free of all this. You won't have to shoulder this burden anymore. You can finally live your own life.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

My best friend Patty died six months ago from cancer.\\\"\n\\\"I'm Jack. My wife, Katherine, passed last January. She was sixty-seven.\\\"\nThey called it the Good Mourning Group.\nThe group met every Sunday, 7 a.m. sharp, in the basement of the Wrightsville Beach Baptist Church. There were seven patrons in attendance, each one with their own particular story of how they'd ended up there in that dank little room. That wasn't including Phil Moulson, the gangly forty-three-year-old with a moustache so large it could give Colonel Mustard a run for his money, who was in charge of the group. They sat in a small circlet of blue plastic chairs towards the centre of the room, all of them occupied except one. That was an oddity in and of itself. Normally, every chair was filled.\nHadley Brown sat in one of the filled chairs, listening with disinterest as Phil went around the group. Her eyes were trained on the solitary blue chair next to Phil who, as group leader to the Good Mourning group, was taking the responsibility of asking each of the patron's to recap how it was that they'd ended up in the basement that smelled of grief and depression.\nThese two particular emotions, Hadley had come to note, had their own particular scent. Damp and cold, telling of a life confined with dinner for one and more than a few glasses of wine to go with it, enough that you could no longer remember why you were grieving in the first place. It smelt of barely-washed hair and a picked-over breakfast and that book that you'd started once upon a time but were likely never going to finish now.\nThat was what grief and depression smelt like.\nShe picked at her nails, listening as Clara recounted the story of her husband's death before talk turned to Tommy lamenting about his cousin and finally\u2014\n\\\"Hadley?\\\"\nShe tore her gaze away from the empty chair in order to meet Phil's eyes. They were beady little things, so brown that they were almost black, behind wiry glasses. He had a thin crop of blond hair that was thinning rapidly. He gazed at her expectantly, waiting for her to start.\nHadley rolled her eyes, took a breath, and got ready to endure the torture. \\\"I'm Hadley. My broth\u2014\\\"\nShe was cut off as the door to the basement opened, flooding the room with a breath of fresh, un-grieving air, before it slammed shut again. The entire group turned to watch as a tall gangly figure walked in, face hidden beneath a dark hooded sweater, and hands stuffed into their pockets.\n\\\"Ah,\\\" Phil said as the person drew nearer. \\\"You must be Dion. Please, take a seat.\\\"\nDion walked over to the last empty blue chair, the one that was unfortunately next to Phil, and collapsed into it. He threw his dark hood back, revealing chocolaty brown skin and a buzz of brown hair. His eyes were tired, as if he hadn't been sleeping much.\nIt was only then that Hadley realized how young he was. Dion was perhaps fourteen or fifteen, around three or four years younger than she was, but he had the same haggard look on his face that she knew that she had. It was a look that screamed that he was too young for the harshness of the world.\nThere was one upside to Dion's grief, Hadley realized, and that was the fact that Phil seemed to have forgotten all about her. He focused his attention on the group's newest member. He was wearing that expression that seemingly said 'yes, you can talk to me. I'm a trained professional.'\n\nExcept, he wasn't. Phil was no more of a trained therapist than she was. But somehow Phil had managed to land the job as group leader and now spent every Sunday morning attempting to dig the members of the Good Mourning group out of their grief.\nHe's probably still living out of his mother's basement, Hadley thought to herself. Phil had that look about him. The kind that said he liked pretending that he was in a better headspace than the rest of the group when in reality he was probably no better off than the rest of them.\nHadley was near certain that Phil had never lost anyone that he cared about. If he had, there was not a chance in hell that he would be as nice as he was. That was what grief did. It took control and changed you until you didn't really remember who you were before the grief hit.\nShe knew that she was being judgemental and cynical but she didn't really care. The entire group judged Phil. Mostly behind his back, but Clara had been known to spit out a harsh phrase here or there whenever Phil was being particularly forceful on a touchy subject. It usually did the trick and provided enough of a diversion that Phil forgot what he was talking about and allowed the conversation to move forward without pause.\n\\\"Why don't you introduce yourself and tell us why you're here,\\\" Phil suggested to Dion. His tone was so sickly sweet that Hadley felt like hurling.\nTommy caught her gaze from across the circle and rolled his eyes while shooting her a wry smile. To his left, Adam faked gagging but no one but Hadley caught it.\nDion stared at Phil mutely. It was clear to almost everyone that he was being forced into attending the group. The few that had signed up for therapy without any prompting all but fell over themselves to talk about their feelings. Everyone else had to have their emotions yanked out of them with force, like pulling teeth.\nWhen it became apparent to the boy that Phil wasn't going to ignore him and move on to the next person, he signed. \\\"Name's Dion. I'm here because my dad is dead and my mom won't stop sleeping with people. And no, I don't mean that in the platonic sense.\\\"\nOkay, Hadley thought, taken aback. I was not expecting that one.\nNeither, it seemed, had Phil. His beady dark eyes stared blankly at Dion for a moment as he frowned. This was what Hadley liked to call his 'thinking-therapist' face. He used it constantly on the group to make them all think that he was actually licensed.\n\\\"Hmm. And how do you feel about that, Dion?\\\"\nAt one point, before Hadley joined the Good Mourning group, she might have actually liked Phil. He could have been someone who she found engaging instead of grating. She might have actually laughed at his lame attempts at jokes instead of staring at him in a sullen silence.\nBut, any chance she'd ever had at liking Phil had gone out the window when she'd first descended the stairs into the basement dungeon where they housed the group meetings. Now, Hadley could only associate Phil with annoyance and frustration and instead of listening intently at group meetings, Hadley spent her time there envisioning all of the different ways that she could throttle him.\nDion shrugged noncommittally. \\\"I don't care. I'd like it if she stopped doing it on my bed though.\\\"\n\\\"Well,\\\" Phil said. He blinked and then swallowed and looked around the circle, looking for an out so he could have more time to figure out what kind of doctor-like advice he could offer the kid, before his gaze landed on Hadley again.\nShe sighed internally. Shit.\n\\\"Oh, Hadley!\\\" Phil exclaimed, his apologetic therapist-tone coming into play. \\\"I'm so sorry. We completely invaded your time.\\\"\n\n\n\\\"It's fine,\\\" she said as she waved off his attempts. Hair, long and blonde, fell into her eyes. Normally, she would brush it away\u2014an automatic response. This time; however, she let it hang. A curtain protecting her from Phil's neurotic ways.\n\\\"No, no. Go ahead. Tell us why you're here.\\\" Phil leaned forward eagerly in his chair. As if he hadn't already heard the story a million times before.\nDion sat back in his chair, eyes turned upwards towards the ceiling. He seemed glad that Phil had moved on from him.\nHadley; however, was not. She rolled her eyes. Adam sniggered. Clara went cross-eyed at her from across the room for no good reason other than to throw her off balance.\n\\\"My brother committed suicide three months and twenty-five days ago. I'm here because my parents are forcing me to be come because they think I'm going to go off the deep end like he did.\\\" Her tone was flat.\n\\\"Are you?\\\" Phil asked. He cocked his head to the side, waiting on her response.\n\n\n\n"}

No way! What are you doing here?\\\" Calvin exclaims as he catches sight of me on his way to the men's restroom. \nHe's stunningly hot with bull-like muscles on his forearms. From the second he wrapped his arm around my waist in Square Dancing class last year, I knew I needed to see more of that body than just the peep of a belly button I got when he stretched while yawning in AP English. \n\\\"What the heck?\\\" Calvin asks as he approaches me and wraps his big arms around me. His Gap sweatshirt feels damp against my cheek, but he smells like fresh laundry, as always. Calvin is built like an NFL quarterback, and that means he doesn't smell bad, ever. Even if he does smell, it's just Androstenol, a male pheromone that makes him even more attractive. \n\\\"Yo, Andy, look! It's Sara, from my AP Bio class.\\\" \n\\\"Sara?\\\" Andrew asks, and I wince at the sight of Andrew Jones, the annoying Math team captain with the acne problem. It figures that Andrew would be here; he and Calvin published a paper together last year about discovering a new type of bacteria. It's all just fodder for college, and I know Calvin is aiming for Harvard undergrad and that is very competitive. Calvin is the perfect candidate, he'll get in for sure. \\\"What are you doing here in Shanghai? Visiting family?\\\"\nI roll my eyes so hard, they nearly leave my head and score a strike in Andrew's balls. \n\\\"I'm here for the acupuncture program. I've always wanted to work in a developing country and serve an underprivileged population.\\\"\nYes, that is the standard answer that I intend to put on my college application. My dad wants me to go to Columbia because that's where he went, but that's the only place I don't want to apply to. Maybe I'll go to Harvard, with Calvin. We can look back on this trip and reminisce about how fate brought us together in an airport in Shanghai.\u00a0\n\\\"It's so cool to have you here,\\\" Calvin replies with the slightest of smirks gracing his supermanesque chin. \\\"We're going to have so much fun together! What happens here in Shanghai, stays in Shanghai, right guys?\\\"\nI chuckle and feel the butterflies erupt again in my belly. How can anyone say 'no' to a boy with a smile so smooth he can talk his way into being the first author of a paper that Andy wrote with his mom, an epidemiologist at Weill Cornell. \n\\\"I can see if I can get my hands on some top-shelf baijiu for us,\\\" I reply. \\\"I speak Shanghainese, so maybe they won't even ask for ID.\\\"\n\n\n\n"}

People were scary, intimidating-and tall.\nLike, really, really tall.\nBut I was smart, I guess, and quiet, so my parents and teachers seemed to assume the ease and enjoyment of my schooling days to be a given. My teachers doted on me endlessly-which sounds fun, but really wasn't. It honestly just led to a lot of awkward interactions and forced, too-bright smiling.\nLike today, in English, when Mr. Reiner informed the class we'd be starting a new assignment, and then beamed at me with the eagerness of an overexcited puppy.\n\\\"Yes, it's going to be very exciting,\\\" Mr Reiner continued when the usual unenthusiastic groans had died down. \\\"A real treat, if I do say so myself.\\\" He adjusted his thick, wide-rimmed glasses and peered hopefully over at Robert Wilson, my companion in academic prowess and mediocre social skills.\nRobert gave a tentative thumbs up, and muttered in my ear when an ecstatic Mr. Reiner turned back to the class, \\\"Poor bastard. Must not have many friends.\\\"\nI huffed a laugh. \\\"Him? Perish the thought.\\\"\nMr. Reiner clapped his hands. \\\"So, class, here's the goss.\\\"\nCue blank stares.\n\\\"Goss? Gossip? Eh, whatever.\\\"\nStill smiling at us, he blindly reached into his desk and pulled a book from its drawer. \\\"Class, let me introduce you to my favourite book.\\\"\nA series of hysterical howls pierced the air, followed by a few loud jeers and a whistle: Mr. Reiner was holding a lewd magazine, featuring a half-naked woman on the hood of a sports car, sunglasses and all.\n\\\"Way to go, sir!\\\"\n\\\"Ey! Now that's a piece of literature!\\\"\n\\\"Hey, Miller!\\\"\nThe sound of my name made me turn suddenly, and I stared right into the grinning, obnoxiously handsome face of Cash Smith: Star athlete, quarter back for the football team, and general juvenile douchebag. His eyes were the kind of blue you could gaze into all day, and his hair, blonde, slightly ruffled, shining radiantly in the sunshine pouring in through a window, hung perfectly about his chiselled face. Plus, he had abs. Like, we're talking abs. He could play a superhero in an action film, he could model for a famous agency, he could sell me anything in the middle of a shopping centre. And now he was looking at me, talking to me, opening his perfect lips just to say:\n\\\"Bet that looks familiar!\\\"\nHis beautiful face contorted into a wicked grin, and his friends, fellow football douchebags, all broke into mocking laughter again.\n\\\"Nah, bro.\\\" Designated douchebag best friend Bryce Greene slapped him on the shoulder. \\\"We all know he's gay.\\\"\nI turned away abruptly, scowling furiously, my face red. They were all assholes, the lot of them.\nBut they were also right.\nBy now Mr. Reiner had peered anxiously at the magazine's cover and, stuttering, stuffed it back into his drawer and pulled out a copy of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' instead.\n\\\"L-Let's forget about that,\\\" he suggested, wiping the back of his hand across his forehead. He looked about to faint.\nRobert shook his head. \\\"Poor, poor bastard.\\\"\n\n\n\\\"So, as I was saying, this is my favourite book: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee. Generic yes, but a classic all the same. I used to read it when I was in high school, and it's brought me a lot of joy throughout my life. Books are magical. Books can transport you.\\\"\nThere was a sheen to his eyes, a maniacal excitement twinkling there.\n\\\"Which brings me to today's assignment: As a class, you're each going to submit your favourite book, and then I'm going to partner you up and assign you the other's book to read. After that, you'll be given a log-in to a virtual chatroom so that you can discuss the books you read. The entire thing will be anonymous; no one needs to know your identity if you don't want them to. But, hopefully, you'll have made a new friend-and gained a new perspective on life.\\\"\nHe stood back as the class gaped in an astonished silence, staring open-mouthed at each other. There was a pride to Mr. Reiner, an aura of great accomplishment, even if all he'd achieved was silencing an eleventh-grade classroom.\nActually, nevermind; that is quite an achievement.\n\\\"Quite a...unique assignment,\\\" Robert muttered.\n\\\"I just hope I don't get stuck analysing Bryce's playboys,\\\" I sighed back.\n\\\"Not a lot of work to do this lesson.\\\" Mr. Reiner returned to his desk and settled behind it, pulling his laptop open. \\\"I'd like you all to use this time to consider which book you're going to bring in next lesson.\\\"\nThe class lapsed into a steady stream of chatter. \nRobert leaned back in his chair and stretched. \\\"What'd you gonna bring in?\\\"\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" I replied honestly. I had a few books in mind, but I still had to decide which one would be less humiliating for me if a student of Grammarville were to read it.\nRobert grinned. \\\"Don't bring in one of your gay erotica's.\\\"\n\\\"Only if you don't bring in a football playthrough,\\\" I shot back.\nHe winced. \\\"Low blow. I still haven't told my dad yet.\\\"\nI stood as the bell rang and began to collect my textbooks. \\\"He still thinks you're the team's star quarter back?\\\"\n\\\"It's gotten bad. I've started forging emails from 'coachwestley.grammarville@gmail.com'\\\"\n\\\"Yikes. You're such a clich\u00e9.\\\"\n\\\"Ugh, I know. I'm prime teen movie love interest material.\\\"\n\\\"You're gonna have to tell him, man.\\\" I waved to Mr. Reiner as we left the classroom, who waved back with a broad grin. \\\"Eventually he's gonna want to see you play.\\\"\nRobert sighed and began to rub the back of his neck. \\\"Yeah, well, I'm just hoping his law firm keeps sending him on business trips.\\\"\nAt this, I couldn't contain my laughter. \\\"That's what you pray for every night, isn't it? 'Dear Lord, please send my father back to Tokyo, so that he won't come home and realise I'm an enormous failure with absolutely no sporting chops'-\\\"\n\\\"Yes, thankyou-\\\"\n\\\"Hey, Miller!\\\"\nWe glanced over our shoulders as we made our way down the hall, and there was Cash, gliding toward us with the air of a god-superior, beautiful, cruel. He was smirking and ruffling his hair, Bryce at his side, stealing the breath from my lungs and the logic from my brain.\n\\\"What books are we choosing for the assignment, boys?\\\" Bryce teased as they paused before us. He had greasy brown hair and dull, ruddy skin, and honestly, he could really take a few hair styling tips from Cash. Or even Robert, who always had his dirty blonde hair neatly combed.\n\\\"A dictionary, maybe?\\\" Cash added, blinking innocently. \\\"Perhaps a maths textbook?\\\"\nBryce snorted. \\\"We all know he's gonna bring in some gay porno.\\\"\nThe pair snickered loudly and I scowled despite myself. It was relatively the same joke Robert had made earlier, but it was decidedly less funny.\n\n\n\n"}

My fingers were tightly wrapped around the sink and my eyes were shut firmly. I always hated the first look.\nAs my eyes slowly peered open, I took in who I was today: a red head. I'm rarely ever that. I had dark brown eyes and dark freckles splattered across my nose. I was about five foot seven, almost two inches taller than yesterday. There was a gap in between my two front teeth.\nI headed out of the bathroom into my bedroom. It was a mess. Clothes covered the floor, the dressers were cluttered with junk, and the closet was spewing out even more clothes. Today, I wasn't a clean person.\nI got onto my hands and knees and searched through all the items on the floor. I threw clothes over my head. I needed some kind of identification and I usually can always find it in the purse. I just couldn't find one right now.\nI shoved my hand under the bed and my fingers wrapped around a leathery object. When I pulled it out I saw it was my purse. I threw it up onto the bed and I sat down next to it.\nI flipped the purse over and dumped all the contents on the bed. This place was already a pigsty, so what's a little more mess for one day?\nPushing aside the loose change and make-up, I found my wallet. I pulled out the drivers licence and discovered that I am Cassandra Lowe. I also found out that I am twenty-three, take the bus, have quite a few gift cards to clothing stores, go to yoga classes and have two men's phone numbers. The last thing I discovered was that I'm an organ donor.\nMy heart pounded in my chest when I heard a knock on the door. I didn't know anyone in my life. So how am I supposed to recognize who's at the door? Anyways, it's nine a.m. who would come this early in the morning?\nI got up and made my way across the tiny apartment. A couple more loud knocks came at the door. The person is probably trying to wake me up in case I was asleep.\nAs soon as I opened the door a man wrapped his arms around my waist. He pressed his lips hard against mine. He must be my boyfriend; it's the only logical solution. Now what's his name? I tried to think back to the names on those napkins. He was either Charles or Stuart.\nWhen the man backed away from me he had a smile on his face. I let a smile grow across mine. He ran his hand through his dark short-cropped hair.\n\\\"You're not ready yet, Cass?\\\" he asked letting his eyes set onto my body. I looked down at myself. I had on a pair of blue flannel pyjama bottoms and a grey tank top.\n\\\"Sorry, I'll get changed...um where are we going again?\\\" I asked, trying not to sound like I didn't have a clue about anything in my life.\nThe man still scrunched his eyebrows at me.\n\\\"We were going to go have breakfast before I had to go to work,\\\" he said. \\\"Remember?\\\" \nI just nodded my head and let another big smile grow across my lips. I wrapped my arms around his neck.\n\\\"Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll get ready right now,\\\" I said.\nI kissed him quickly and then turned on my heels. This is his last day with Cassandra, so it might as well be a good one.\nHe sat down on the couch as I went into my room. I quickly put on a pair of jeans, a white shirt and a black vest. I found a brush among the mess on the dresser. I began running it through my hair. I was trying to find out this man's name. I dropped the brush back down on the dresser and saw my phone lying there.\n\nI opened my bedroom door and poked my head out of the doorframe. I flashed another smile at him.\n\\\"I lost my phone. Can you call it, honey?\\\" I asked him sweetly.\nHe pulled his phone out of his pocket.\n\\\"Sure. But if you cleaned up like I suggest you wouldn't have this problem,\\\" he said.\nHe dialled my number and I heard my phone ring. I ran into my room and looked at my phone. Thank God for caller I.D. The name Jackson flashed across the screen.\nJackson? That wasn't one of the names on the napkins. I must be a two-timer.\nI put my contents back into my purse quickly and shoved my phone into my pocket. I went back out into the living room. Jackson was still sitting on the couch. When he saw me he got up.\n\\\"Thank you, Jackson,\\\" I said.\nI gave him a quick kiss and took his hand in mine. We walked down the hallway of my building. Before we left I took a quick look at my door. I live in 412. I'll need to remember that if I want a place to stay today. I've made that mistake a few times before.\nAs we walked down the stairs Jackson continued to talk.\n\\\"So how does Devin feel about you moving?\\\" he asked me.\nShit a question. I hate questions; they're almost impossible to answer. If he was just telling me a story all I would need to do is nod my head.\n\\\"He's not that supportive of it,\\\" I said, throwing out a wild guess.\n\\\"Really? I thought he would have loved the idea,\\\" he told me.\n\\\"Well, yeah,\\\" I said. I needed to think quickly. \\\"He's just worried about me, you know?\\\"\n\\\"I understand. I get very protective over my little brother.\\\"\nLittle brother? Devin must be my older brother, and I'm moving. To where and why I don't know yet.\nWhen Jackson opened the building door, I waited for him. I change cities at least once a week. I never knew the layout of the city that well before I woke up in a new one. Jackson would have to take the lead to show me where we were going to eat.\n\\\"How do you feel about me moving?\\\" I asked him.\nJackson looked surprised by my question. It must be something we have discussed for a while now. I felt stupid for asking.\n\\\"I think it's wonderful you want to live with me,\\\" he said. \\\"You already know I love you.\\\" \nI pressed my lips into a smile. More information for me to store in my brain. Now hopefully I don't forget it or confuse it with other girls' information.\n\\\"You seriously think you can deal with my mess?\\\" I asked him jokingly.\nHe laughed and shook his head.\n\\\"Probably not,\\\" he murmured.\nWe ended up at a coffee shop. It was full of people and we squeezed between the crowd and into the line. A man in a green apron and long hair was taking everyone's orders quickly. This caused a pile up on all the workers actually making the coffee, this led to the workers arguing with each other. I found this comical and started to chuckle under my breath.\nJackson stared down at me giving me another one of his quizzical looks.\n\\\"This always pisses you off and gets you angry,\\\" he said.\nI shrugged my shoulders. I need another excuse.\n\n\n\n"}

He kept my world safe.\nBut now he's gone.\nCold bit through my bones. The nearly moonless night carried the chills of winter into spring. Sleep still tugged at me as I stood with my family outside of Westminster Abbey. A sense of unreality settled over me, and I half-believed that the world of dreams still had me in its grip.\nI rubbed my bleary eyes, catching sight of my guardian. Queen Elizabeth stood with her men, as though leading a siege. Torches surrounded her, adding an almost hellish aura to Elizabeth. If an ill-minded person came across the scene, they would believe the rumors of her witchcraft practices.\nNot that anyone would accuse the Queen of witchcraft to her face. No one dared cross Elizabeth Woodville. The last who openly insulted her ended up drowned in a cask of wine. Even my fearless father wouldn't argue with her. I didn't know a soul who would dare.\n\\\"Mama, have you gone mad?\\\"\nPerhaps there was still one.\nI winced at the words of my sister, Bess. She opened her mouth, only to be interrupted as a loud crash tore through the still night. The noise sounded like the howls of hell. A cloud of dust wafted up, and I broke into a choking fit, moving my baby sister Bridget back. The dust and flames put more thoughts of hell into my mind. Men shrouded in shadows, looking like demonic minions, intent on breaking down the barrier to one of the most sacred spots in England.\nBridget let out a startled cry, and I hastened to hush her. The poor babe was recovering from an illness. Thunderous booms and icy night air wouldn't do her any good. I rubbed her cold little hands, wishing I could get her back to a warm bed.\nWishing I could get back to a warm bed.\nThe crash didn't deter Bess. Hidden in the shadows of the night, her beauty still shone in the limited light. Her golden hair tumbled loose, dancing in the winds of spring. She strode up to her mother, as regal as when she was promised to the Dauphin. Never mind that the royal family of York was outside Westminster Abbey, claiming sanctuary like thieves in the night.\nActual thieves. Piles of treasure surrounded my father's wife, all taken from the palace. An overwhelming bounty of riches, some items too great to fit into the building. Not at the speed she wanted.\nSo her servants were knocking down the wall.\nOnly seventeen, but with the courage of our father, Bess stepped forward as if preparing for battle. \\\"Stop,\\\" she commanded the servants. \\\"The Duke of Gloucester shall be ill-pleased with this business.\\\"\n\\\"Keep going,\\\" Queen Elizabeth countermanded.\nAnother crash rang out, and Bridget burst into tears. I tried to soothe her, but I felt like crying myself. I wanted Papa to come back, to make everything right.\n\\\"Grace?\\\" My sister, seven-year-old Anne, tugged on my sleeve. \\\"Kat is running off.\\\"\nI looked around through the rubble and dust as my three-year-old sister ran toward the broken wall. No nursemaid stopped her. Elizabeth collected all the treasure from the palace but hadn't thought to bring a nursemaid for her children. It had all fallen on me.\n\\\"Cecily?\\\" I hissed to my fourteen-year-old sister. \\\"Fetch Katherine. She's going to get hurt.\\\"\nCecily stayed still. She stood with the dignity of a princess, but all life had left her eyes.\n\\\"Wake up!\\\" Frustration forced a cry into my words, but it didn't get her to move.\nUnable to wait longer, I darted forward, lugging my wailing sister. Bridget's hot cries and protesting body slowed me down, just as Katherine fell in front of a man larger than my father.\n\n\n\\\"Come here!\\\" Quick as a flash, my younger brother Dickon grabbed Katherine's hand, pulling her out of the way. \\\"You must mind the workers. They are helping us.\\\"\n\\\"They're ogres,\\\" Katherine said, nearly lisping the words. \\\"Is this the faerie realm?\\\"\nI took a deep breath, trying to steady myself as Dickon led Katherine back to safety. Dirt smudged her face, and a cut marred her cheek, but she shed no tears.\nUnlike the wailing sister in my arms.\n\\\"They are just workers trying to help us!\\\" I said over Bridget's crying.\n\\\"Grace!\\\" Elizabeth's sharp voice rang out over the sounds of the wall coming down, and Bridget's unholy crying. \\\"Keep those children quiet.\\\"\nI bit my lip. Exhaustion and fear almost brought a retort from me. I didn't know how to keep them calm. Most of my time was spent as a companion to my sisters, Cecily and Mary.\nBefore Mary died.\n\\\"Faith, Mama, the children are terrified!\\\" Bess snapped. \\\"You woke them up in the middle of the night to flee as if barbarians are at the gate.\\\"\nElizabeth turned to her eldest daughter. \\\"We have to make haste. Your uncle will be here soon, and we cannot let him capture us. We must regain your brother.\\\"\n\\\"Which brother? Two of them are here!\\\" Bess pointed to her half brother, Thomas Grey, Marquess of Dorset, who was directing the workers and then gestured to Dickon. \\\"And the other two are far away. But I imagine you mean the only brother that matters to you. Edward.\\\"\nI glanced at Dickon. Still just a child of nine years, he showed no hurt at the harsh words. He knew all his life that he was second to our brother, Edward. Dickon wasn't even the only Richard of his siblings. His half-brother Richard Grey attended Edward. I had a considerable lack of importance, but at least I had my own name.\n\\\"Of course, I meant my son the King.\\\" Elizabeth showed no disturbance as the wall continued to fall. \\\"He has been taken by Gloucester. Taken! Surely you understand what that means.\\\"\nBess held up her hands. \\\"Mama, Richard won't hurt our Edward. He's ever been kind to us all, and only wishes to fulfill Papa's last request.\\\" She looked around before pointing at me. \\\"You agree, don't you, Grace?\\\"\nI squirmed. Being singled out by my golden sister should be an honor, but I suspected she picked the only one likely to back up her argument.\n\\\"But he'll be angry with us,\\\" I said, nervousness cracking my voice. \\\"Because we tried to deprive him of being Lord Protector.\\\"\nNot that it was any of our doing. Queen Elizabeth was the one who chose to disregard my father's last wishes. But we were all affiliated with Elizabeth. They were her children, and she was my patron.\n\\\"Thank you, Grace,\\\" Queen Elizabeth said as if I backed her argument. \\\"He's already arrested my brother, my second son, and he has my son, the king, in custody. We have little time before he reaches London.\\\"\nShe turned to instruct a servant, but Bess pushed in front of her mother. \\\"He only arrested Uncle Anthony and Richard Grey because he knows you were trying to cheat Papa's wishes and take power for yourself.\\\"\n\\\"Does it matter the reason?\\\" Elizabeth snapped. \\\"He's done it, and what do you think will happen to any of us? What do you think will happen to Dickon?\\\"\nDickon, brave until this moment, released a whimper. I edged close to him, wishing I could take him in my arms.\n\\\"Richard knows it was your doing and not ours,\\\" Bess said, her beautiful eyes flashing with defiance. \\\"You are just worried about yourself.\\\"\n\\\"God's Blood,\\\" Elizabeth swore, causing Anne to widen her eyes at her mother's language. \\\"None of us are safe. Not one of us. He'll arrest the rest of my brothers, shut you girls up in nunneries, the saints only know what he would do with Dickon, and he'll likely throw Grace out on the streets.\\\"\nTerror shook me. In my fourteen years, my greatest fear was of being thrown away. There was no security in being a bastard daughter, publicly unacknowledged by her father and raised by his wife. Always a supplicant, always needing to plead for a place.\n\\\"Would he do that?\\\" I asked with a squeak.\nBess threw her arms up in the air. \\\"You are seeing shadows, Mama. Richard is\u2014\\\"\nAnother thunderous crash silenced Bess. I bit my lip as little Bridget's cries grew louder. A two-year-old couldn't possibly understand what was happening. None of us did. Not my sisters, not Dorset, nor Elizabeth's bishop brother.\n\n\n\n"}

The same dark hair framing the same pretty face. \nMy stomach drops out from underneath me.

I'm alive.\n\nChapter 2\n\nI've never cut class before, much less skipped the entire last half of school, but there's no way I can stay after getting a text like that. If this is a prank, I'm going to find out. \nAnd if it's not ... \nNo, it's not possible. Emma's been gone for months. When the police found her truck abandoned in a cornfield three hours away from home, its shiny blue paint crusted over with mud, they said she suffered life-threatening injuries based on the amount of blood in the backseat. There were other signs of struggle, too. Clumps of dark hair pulled from her head. A torn varsity jacket. One Adidas tennis shoe lying in a puddle of muck near the road. And a missing cell phone and driver's license.\nBut what if the text is real? What if Emma's alive? \nMy stomach clenches. I don't want to get my hopes up only to discover it's not true, it'd be like losing her all over again. The first time was hard enough. \nBut here's the thing. The text said: Long time no see. That was an inside joke we said to each other every day. Because when you saw one of us, you knew the other was nearby. We were inseparable.\nUntil she disappeared six months ago. \nWith white knuckles, I clutch the steering wheel of my CR-V, and follow the winding roads through town. The pavement is slick with rain. I'm taking the curves faster than I should, but I can't slow down, my toe pressing harder against the gas pedal. I need answers, and there's only one place I'm going to find them.\nIt doesn't take long before I squeal into a driveway, my wheels bumping over the curb, and follow the stamped concrete toward a spectacular log home. But for all its grandeur, there's something bland about the Navarro residence. A dullness stretches throughout the interior and leaks from the arched windows, coating the property in a protective layer of film. Look, but don't touch. Isn't that Mrs. Navarro's motto? The perfect house for the perfect family, nestled inside the perfect neighborhood.\nI unlock the seat belt and tumble out of my SUV, not even bothering to close the door behind me. As I make my way up the stairs and onto the wraparound porch, my legs are slow and heavy, like they're weighted with wet sand. \nBefore I can knock, the front door swings open, and Mrs. Navarro's stunned expression brings me to a halt. \nI knew she'd be home. Since Emma died\u2014I mean, went missing\u2014she never leaves the house. It's like she's making up for all the time she spent working while Emma was still around. \nShe stumbles from the entryway into my arms, her thin shoulders trembling so violently she looks like she's having a seizure. I lock my legs, and try to hold her up, but she's dead weight in my grasp. We crash to our knees, the damp porch soaking through my jeans. \nBut she doesn't miss a beat, like the fall never happened. Her face is red, eyes like slits, cheeks streaked with tears. Her breaths punch in and out of her mouth and I can't make out what she's saying.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nFired: Nick works in an office in San Diago. Today he gets fired by Jayden his boss from Libretec where he works. He dreams of becoming a swimmer.

How's the report coming along?\\\"\nNick blinked in surprise at the indistinct figure standing at the entrance to his cubicle, silhouetted against the dim light of the nighttime office. He'd assumed Jayden had long since gone home. Arranging his features into a smile, he gave a thumbs up.\nHis boss returned the gesture. \\\"Cool. Shoot me through a copy and I'll give it a once-over first thing, before sending it on upstairs.\\\"\nNick nodded, hoping that would be that, but as Jayden seemed disinclined to leave, he assumed something a little more vocal was required to finalise their 'conversation'. \\\"Sh-sh-sure thing,\\\" he managed.\n\\\"Great,\\\" responded Jayden. \\\"Hey, listen\u2014while we've got the place to ourselves, I thought we might have a little chat. Sound good?\\\"\nGiven chats were one of Nick's least favourite things, it sounded awful, but as the question was no doubt rhetorical, he nodded again, heart sinking and expression wary. Even more so when Jayden retrieved a chair from the adjoining cubicle and took a seat opposite him.\nThe tanned and bristled features took on a serious cast. \\\"Listen, bro. There's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna come right out with it. We're letting you go.\\\"\nNick stared at him, dumbstruck\u2014even more so than usual. He'd thought Jayden was going to tell him he'd made some sort of technical error, maybe missed something on a previous report, or even just forgotten to refill the coffee machine one too many times. He'd assumed he was about to get a reprimand or maybe even a reassignment. But to be fired? It didn't make any sense. His work was good and he knew it.\nAnd as his stunned mind baulked at the magnitude of this development, his gaze was drawn, without conscious volition, to the window closest to his cubicle. To the vista which over the last few months had become his mental haven in times of stress.\n\nIt was an oasis. An island of tranquillity, nestled away among the bustle and grime and endless clamour of the city. As blue as the sky Nick never seemed to see anymore, up beyond the steel and the concrete and the haze. Sparkling, pristine.\nAnd, as far as he could tell, unused.\nNo svelte, swimsuited figures ever disturbed the still waters. No tanned bodies disrupted the rank of deckchairs, their white perfection arrayed in gleaming defiance of their drab surrounds.\nIn the nine months since Nick had started at LibreTec, in the thirty-nine weeks and two days since he'd been assigned to the not-quite corner cubicle on the thirty-seventh floor, eight cubicles down from the coffee machine and six cubicles across from the first of the real offices, the ones with walls that reached the ceiling and actual doorways with actual doors, in the two hundred and seventy-five days since his work-glazed eyes were first drawn to the startling incongruity of the swimming pool, shimmering in sapphire-hued allure on the rooftop of the adjoining building, he'd never seen so much as a pool-boy, nor even a gardener to tend the immaculate greenery that so strikingly framed the blue.\nIn time, it had become his oasis. His sanctuary, if only by proxy. After all, it didn't seem to be anybody else's. Yes, he could only see it through the sizeable gap in the corner-seam of his cubicle, and even then, only if Sasha next-door wasn't in the way, but that did nothing to lessen his sense of possession.\nNor the pleasure of his discovery, as he'd worked long into this late-summer evening, that night would not deprive him of his illicit, illusory getaway. Aglow with some sort of internal illumination, ethereal and other-worldly, the cool-blue oblong floated in jewel-like splendour among the muted greys, the murky blacks and the garish neon of the city after dark.\nThe city where his co-workers, his colleagues\u2014there were none he could yet call friends\u2014were no doubt drinking and dating and living their lives and just doing all those things he assumed young urban professionals did in their spare time. All the things he'd thought\u2014he'd hoped\u2014he'd do, when he moved to San Diego, full of ambition and wishes and dreams and above all else, the desire to change; the determination to become someone other than the person he'd been for the twenty-four years of his life so far.\nOnly, it hadn't proven quite that easy. As it turned out, a new job, a new home\u2014a new life, did not magically result in a new Nick. He'd packed light for the big move, but wound up with unwanted baggage anyway. The awkwardness had come along. The shyness had hitched a ride. The uncertainty, the self-doubt and the anxiety, they'd all squeezed themselves in too.\nAnd, of course, so had the stutter. The ever-present, intractable, pain-in-the-fucking-ass stutter.\nIt was ridiculous to think he could have left it behind. He knew that. And yet, he'd hoped. It really hadn't seemed too much to ask. To make a fresh start. To walk away from his maddening curse, from the hated speech impediment that had cast its shadow over virtually every aspect of his life, on his first day of pre-school and on pretty much every bloody day since.\nIncluding today. Today, when Jayden\u2014his team coordinator, he of the excessive hair-product and the designer growth, had announced the latest Libretec proposal needed a last-minute rewrite. One by one, each and every one of his teammates had voiced their excuses, their apologies, their rock-solid, pre-booked plans, completely unable to be changed.\nEvery one but Nick. It had been so much easier to stay silent. Even though he actually had plans\u2014real ones, unlike half the other shifty-eyed apologists standing around him. He could, with perfect honesty, have piped up and explained that he had a date, a dinner reservation, the whole shebang. With a girl, even.\n\n\nBut he hadn't. It would have been a stretch to say he couldn't\u2014he was a stutterer, not a mute\u2014but not too much of a stretch. One-on-one conversations were enough of a challenge, but vocalising in front of a group? Forget it.\nAnd the saddest thing? If he was being honest with himself, he'd been kind of glad for the excuse.\nOn the whole, it would be fair to say Nick's city adventure, his bold step into a brave, new world, had not been a great success. But while neither a non-existent social life nor doormat status among his co-workers had much to recommend them from an enjoyment point of view, they'd at least been conducive to getting through a truckload of work. And therefore, he'd assumed, to boosting his career prospects.\nAs it turned out\u2014not so much.\nJayden's voice jerked him out of his reverie. \\\"Hello? Earth to Nick. Dude, did you hear what I said?\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

Those who dared visit the forest were never to be seen again, or returned cursed, to kill loved ones they mistook for enemies. Some returned in pieces.\nA small mercy. \n\\\"We're nearly there,\\\" Magnus wheezed, long, dark hair whipping in the wind. \nCaliath sniffed, catching a whiff of wildflowers over the reek of bitter poison, \\\"The other two aren't far I can smell them.\\\"\nThe thought of meeting the other two fae sent a flash of hatred through Caliath so strong that he grasped the hilt of his sword, longing to run it through them. \nBut it was forbidden.\nCaliath and his father approached the centre of the forest to a hollow pit the size of a crater. \nThe breeze died down, leaving an eerie silence in its wake. Dread squirmed in Caliath's belly like a clump of worms. His boots snapped over branches and he winced, trying not to think of the beasts that roamed the forest, hungry for fae flesh. \nThey reached the pit and the silence crept over his skin like a pair of eyes, and his clammy hand darted to his sword again. \nA charge filled the air, threatening, suffocating. \nThe earth was scorched at his feet with a ring of decimated trees around it, reeking of sulphur as if the curse dropped yesterday instead of a thousand years ago. \n\\\"Don't touch the pit,\\\" his father's arm halted Caliath mid step. \\\"You'll burn.\\\"\nA bead of sweat trickled down his neck as he obeyed, and they patiently waited for the other two fae to arrive. \nThe scent of sweet, cloying wildflowers filled the air as the other two fae stepped forward from the trees, wearing cloaks of rich dark velvet. They walked towards Caliath and Magnus as silent as a pair of wraiths.\nCaliath's jaw clenched at the familiar pale features and corn silk hair, typical of the fae belonging to the royal house of Golah. \n\\\"Greetings,\\\" King Erik said, the elder of the two fae, vulpine face twisting into a smirk. \n\\\"Greetings,\\\" Magnus replied.\nCaliath glared at the younger fae, Prince Damon, a fae that was older than him by a century. \nTo a human observer Damon would appear to be in his early twenties and Caliath in his late teens. \nDamon surveyed Caliath with ice blue eyes, his features a cold mask. \nA silence followed as tense as a coil of wire about to snap. \n\\\"I felt the power surge the other night,\\\" Erik said.\n\\\"So did I,\\\" Magnus replied. \n\\\"If it is what I think it is...\\\"\n\\\"Then there hasn't been one for a thousand years.\\\"\nBoth kings stared each other down, power thrumming between them. \n\\\"The very lives of the fae are at risk,\\\" said Erik. \n\\\"We can take her in,\\\" Magnus shifted, standing taller. \n\\\"You take her in? And what will you do with her?\\\"\n\\\"We can raise her as one of our own.\\\"\n\\\"Why would we allow that? You weren't on the right side of the war a thousand years ago,\\\" Erik sneered. His son, Damon, smirked at his side. \nCaliath hissed, clenching his sword. \n\\\"No, Caliath,\\\" Magnus admonished. \nCaliath shot his father an incredulous look, not understanding how his father could be so calm when the other two fae were behind the ruin of their court. It took all he had to try and choke down his hatred, but it didn't stop the sneer from crossing his lips as he looked at Damon. \nAn amused grin flashed across Damon's face, and Caliath snarled in response, his temper rising like a cauldron about to boil over. Damon chuckled and Caliath launched himself through the air. \n\\\"Stop!\\\" Magnus waved a hand, suspending his son mid-air. \nErik glanced at Caliath with cold disdain, as Damon tried and failed to keep his face straight. \nCaliath's stomach sank at the disappointment on Magnus's face, who turned back to Erik as if his son weren't dangling in the air like a bit of laundry, \\\"Then what do you propose we do?\\\" \n\\\"Our court will take her in.\\\" \nA heavy silence followed.\n\\\"You'll kill her.\\\"\n\\\"Not if we take her in and teach her how to control her power.

She anxiously clutches onto the chiffon fabric of her mermaid gown, using her tight grip to remind herself to maintain her courteous posture.\nThe Selection is incredibly hard to enter. It is held to appoint the future Empress of the modern-day Korean monarchy and it is not a ritual this generation of the nation has seen before. The last time the country had a 'Selection' was hundreds of years ago, turning this occasion into a historical event of some sort. \nYeoreum has heard that this ancient, misogynistic practice is brought back by the Emperor's mother, Empress Dowager, Park Yunhee. In the opening of The Selection, Park Yunhee expressed her concern over how the Emperor is too busy to meet anyone romantically to justify herself. The event has taken the world by storm with foreign media discussing the historical nature of Asian harems and the domestic media predicting who is most likely going to strut their way to the Amethyst Empress Crown. Of course, none of the commoner contestants was on that list.\nNinety-five per cent of the contestants are daughters of high birth. Yeoreum would have never received an invite if she didn't get into Seoul Medical School with near-perfect exam results. \n\\\"Song Yeoreum,\\\" a firm voice calls from the big, booming speakers, dragging Yeoreum out of her musing.\nImmediately, Yeoreum feels a ring of shrewd eyes fall upon her, pricking every inch of her exposed skin. The circle of women seated at the fore of the large hall twirls their exquisite fans of feathers and lace as they scrutinise Yeoreum like scouring eagles securing their next meal. \nYeoreum senses their glances but she doesn't mind them too much. She has already accomplished her mission with the five hundred US dollars she has obtained by attending today's round.\n\\\"Your Majesty.\\\" Yeoreum steps forward and bows towards the man behind the black curtains according to the instructions. \nA cloudy spotlight pins onto her figure, casting a delicate shine over her round profile that is only as big as a hand. She suppresses the urge to squint at the sudden light. A watery glisten catches onto her satin brown pupils, adorning her wide eyes with a touch of frailty that is capable of compelling anyone to do anything.\n\\\"Song...Yeoreum?\\\" the man behind the curtain utters.\nYeoreum shudders. This is the first time he has said anything today. She looks down to the cherry hue that stained her index finger when she tried a lipstick sample on her bus ride here. Red is a good colour. Perhaps it is a lucky omen that'll push her all the way into the Top Five and the additional one thousand US dollars that achievement entail. Her brain spins to convert the crashing dollar signs. Mathematics was never her strong suit but numerical figures are so much more workable when it comes to the concept of money. Roughly, that counts to one million Korean won. Her pillowy cherry lips almost fall ajar as she realises how much of her father's debt she'll be able to pay if her wish comes true.\n\\\"Yeoreum, summer...\\\" the man murmurs. Though the resonance of his voice seems more toned down this time, it sounds a lot clearer to Yeoreum.\nA series of gasps and shrieks trickle across the crowd of contestants. Some of the less composed contestants break their composure and peer towards Yeoreum's direction.\nYeoreum lifts her gaze and finds herself gazing at a bewitching profile.\nIt's Kim Taehyung, this country's Emperor.\nYeoreum's frantic eyes flutter in awe. Taehyung's chiselled, deep-set features are masterfully delicate. Just as if God had intricately sculpted each and every detail with skilful, vigilant fondles and caresses. The gold Rose of Sharon badge on his left chest emits a beauteous yet piercing stream of brilliance as he steps into her spotlight and leans forward to meet her curious gaze, reiterating the realness of this moment.\nTaehyung folds his lips into a delightful smile, completely disregarding the shock that has flared across the room. \\\"I am quite fond of your name, Song Yeoreum-ssi.\u201d\n\nChapter 2\n\nEmperor's pick!

The long black coffee in the cup crushes against the rim, tinting the twenty-four-carat gliding with a delicate hazel hue that resembles the darkness hovered over Park Yunhee's dim gaze.\nThe vibrant colour of the tea set quickly grasps Taehyung's attention. He inspects the vividly depicted image of sparrows and Chinese flowers over the coloured surface he has seen before in the archives of an Australian luxury accessory manufacturer. A serrated fleck of coldness coils onto his features as he realises the origin of his mother's rage.\n\\\"Mother, I am quite fond of Song Yeoreum,\\\" Taehyung utters like he is stating a trivial matter of fact. He folds his lips into a benign smile. \\\"Is Miss Choi Jiyeon back from Melbourne?\\\"\nPark Yunhee examines his expression that is empty of any malice before she heaves a cold, frustrated laugh. \\\"What? Do you want to choose her after the media went crazy over Song Yeoreum and the Top Five selection got cancelled because you made it so clear that you have already made your decision?\\\"\nTaehyung bows his head. \\\"No, mother. I was just wondering if Miss Choi could kindly bring me an English tea set as well. I would like to give Yeoreum-ssi a tea set with summer flowers to welcome her into the family.\\\"\nPark Yunhee's expression darkens. She wants to hurl the table at her son but she fails to find an excuse in the face of his meekness. He is once again obediently looking towards her, his posture constrained in the angelic manner the media is always gushing about. She has a feeling that her son is no longer the person she thought he is but her guess has no trace to follow. \n\\\"There are so many wonderous young women in The Selection. Why did you have to choose Song Yeoreum? She is a commoner, her family is poor and she is not even fully Korean. She is obviously motivated by the monetary rewards to participate in The Selection. This is the Empress of the Empire of Korea you are selecting, not a casual girlfriend. I hope you understand that Taehyung,\\\" Park Yunhee chides with a tone like thunder. She tightens her fists and leans back against her daybed to collect herself. \\\"Are you serious about her?\\\"\n\\\"Yes, mother. I...love Song Yeoreum,\\\" Taehyung says.\nThe gold-brimmed wooden door slides open, allowing a ravishing woman to enter. Her high heels click at the moderate, polite pace all Imperial servants have been trained to walk at but the confidence the bold sounds exude makes it sound like an enchanted drum that naturally stirs people to oblige.\n\\\"Good morning, Your Majesty.\\\" Yoon Soojung bows and delivers Taehyung a brief look of confirmation before she turns to Park Yunhee. \\\"Good Morning, Your Highness.\\\"\n\\\"Well, thank you, Assistant Yoon,\\\" Park Yunhee dismisses with a hollow tsk.\n\\\"Your Highness, that is just basic courtesy\u2013\\\"\n\\\"Looks like you are a great fit for your name, Soojung-ssi.

Have you ever seen anyone go through caffeine withdrawal? Because I have, and it was uglier than roadkill on a hot summer day. My freshman year of college, my roommate decided to give up caffeine as part of some hokey Instagram \\\"detox,\\\" and I swear he had the shakes for a week, like a junkie desperate for a hit. \nGambling addiction triggered the same exact brain areas as drug and alcohol use did, and I witnessed the hysteria of some of those guys when I went to inpatient rehab last year. Nothing made you more crazed than money (or lack of it), and they made my dope benders look like a sunset walk on the beach. \nThere were people who were addicted to sex. While that wasn't me, I was probably addicted to having sex with Sage Heller specifically, despite the fact that she was quite possibly the worst human being on Earth. After years of going back and forth between her and I, I learned I wasn't really any better, and I figured that was why we kept clawing our way back to each other - it wasn't like we'd be good for anyone else. That's probably why despite everything, I was still the first person she called when she came home from college for the summer. It was nearly midnight by the time I slipped through her bedroom window, and it should have felt nostalgic, but something sour sat in the pit of my stomach.\nSage's designer duffle bags still littered the plush carpeted floor of her bedroom, heaps of clothes haphazardly strewn like confetti. We filled the room with smoke before it whooshed out the open window and traded pills in each other's mouths. It ached when she kissed me, but it ached more when she didn't. \n\\\"I really did miss you.\\\"\nI exhaled smoke out of her window before turning myself back around on her cushioned window seat. She sat up in bed, working her fingers through her sex-swept mess of hair. The light of the moon turned her bloodshot eyes to crystal.\n\\\"Did you?\\\" I asked, turning back to the window and taking another hit of the blunt.\nShe scoffed. \\\"Don't be like that, Kai.\\\"\nDon't be like that. Code for don't ask questions you don't want the answer to. I shouldn't have cared, but all the distance we had tried put between us came back with a vengeance. \n\\\"Come back to bed.\\\" Sage patted her comforter on the open spot beside her. \nI did as she asked, but I didn't sleep, my bones and my head rattling as I came down from a swirling high. I was sure by now that my body hated me and all my shit life choices and constantly found ways to remind me of that.\nI slipped out of Sage's bedroom before dawn, plucking my skateboard from behind the azalea bushes that lined the white lattice privacy fence surrounding their overly manicured yard. I unlocked the back gate and trudged through the sand dunes and marram grass (even though there's a thousand signs that say not to do that) until I reached the quiet haven of the beach. I'd always been told I had an addictive personality, and while I craved the normal things like dope and cigarettes, I also craved the peace of the ocean in the early mornings. Some fucking balance to keep me teetering on the edge. \nI took one last look over my shoulder at Sage's house, towering on its six feet of stilts above the beach and piercing the hazy morning sky with its obnoxious shade of coral. It was a place I'd been a million times but still felt unfamiliar.\nIt took almost three miles and four cigarettes to get from Sage's house back to mine. At some point on my walk of shame, still dragging my skateboard and a cloud of smoke behind me, I sat into the sand and shut my eyes. Before I knew it, dawn melted into mid-morning, and I'd melted into the sand.\nWhen you were coming off a bender and you woke up soaking wet and hot, it usually meant one of two things - you had broken a dope sick fever sometime in the middle of the night and were lucky enough to have sweated it out, or you weren't so lucky and you pissed yourself because you have no control over your body's raging war with your shit life choices. One thing that usually didn't come along with soaking wet and hot was a hand on your shoulder and a voice in your ear that maybe, quite possibly, was an angel.\n\\\"Hey...\\\" she shook me again, and even though she probably didn't mean to, it made the aching in my arm worse.\nI tried to open my eyes, but the glare of the morning sun turned everything into a blurry mess of colors. I shut my eyes again in an attempt to soothe my pounding head, the overly pungent smell of low tide churning a storm in me. After slowly trying to adjust to the sunlight, I looked up into a pair of blue eyes so icy, I felt a real chill hit my body. Her face was tanned from the sun with a spattering of freckles, and her cinnamon-colored hair was so long it brushed against my chest when she leaned over me. She wasn't the intense, manufactured beauty I was used to with Sage. She was soft, kind of like the first breeze of the morning before it got bogged down by the heat.\n\\\"You okay?\\\" she asked in a clipped tone. There wasn't an ounce of the southern proper drawl I was used to hearing from people around here. She squinted down at me and pressed her lips into a pout, like she was trying to figure out what kind of animal I was all washed up on the beach.\n\\\"Yeah, I'm fine,\\\" I muttered, gripping sand still cold from the night between my fingers to force some feeling back into them. I heard her scoff in response.\nStill in sensory overload, the smell of vanilla and coconut wafted off of her, and it made my stomach ripple. Whether it was nausea or something else got lost in the morning haze. I swallowed hard and tried to regain my focus. I managed to sit myself up, and she sat back on her knees. Her light, glass-like eyes glinted with the same silent, curious worry that I had grown used to from everyone else around our tiny beach town but I had never seen her before. Was she someone's cousin, or niece, or half-sister, and had whispers of \\\"that Danford kid who can't get his shit together\\\" already reached her ears?\n\\\"Are you sure you're okay?\\\" She tilted her head to the side, firing off words too quickly for me to process. It wasn't the usual sad pitying I was used to, but it wasn't unkind either. It was just plain curiosity. \\\"Do you need help getting home?\\\"\nI shook my head and jerked my thumb over my shoulder. \\\"I live right over there.\\\"\nI knew without even needing to truly look around. Back in high school, I had marked a couple of big rocks by the boardwalk that led from my house to the beach when I had a short-lived relationship with graffiti. They stuck up out of the sand right behind her, the colors faded but still visible, half-coated in seaweed. \n\\\"I uh...\\\" I cleared my throat, trying to get some life back into my mouth so I didn't sound completely strung out. \\\"I must have just fallen asleep on my morning walk. I'm okay, really.\\\"\n\\\"Well, sorry for disrupting your nap then.\\\" She rose to her feet, brushing sand off her leggings. I expected her to turn away, but she didn't, lingering with that same curious look.\n\\\"You know...\\\" she pinched her lips into a frown. \\\"In theory, you're probably a really good liar.\\\"\nI was so gobsmacked by her words, I felt myself tripping over my own in an effort to respond. \\\"I'm sorry, what?\\\"\n\\\"Your eyes,\\\" she said. \\\"When people feel guilty about lying, it's always in their eyes.\\\"\nShe turned away before I had a chance to bite back (though I really didn't know what I could say at that point) and continued her run down the beach. I itched at a scab on the inside of my arm, took a deep breath and hoisted myself to my feet. Sand came flitting off my knees and my elbows, little pieces of me eroding away like the ocean stripped away the shoreline, pulling it all into the depths.\n\n\n\n"}

She performs spells and magic.\n\n#cat, #animals, #fantasy, #magic, #magical\n\nMarvela Mystic \n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nGrudgewood Forest wasn't as ghastly of a place as its name implied. Yet very few people bothered to venture into the old forest anymore, and so the marvelous, mystical wonders within went undiscovered.\nGolden beams of evening light poured forth through the pale boughs of the aspen trees, splashing across fluttering yellow leaves that littered the forest floor. In the fading light, dew sparkled on speckled toadstools and silken spiderwebs. The symphony of the songbirds was reaching its climax as the shadows lengthened. From those shadows rose the fireflies. Scores of flashing lights filled the darkening woods like stars in a galaxy-swirling and spinning, converging and scattering. \nA tiny black paw reached out from beneath the fallen leaves on the ground to stir up all the dancing lights. Soon the furry form of a kitten launched into the air, a cascade of golden leaves rising with her. Her orange eyes were alight like two candle flames as she batted at her luminous friends. Her fur was sleek and black, like a moonless night. Only a single white spot on her chest curiously shaped like a star marked her pelt.\nGrinning and giggling, the kitten crashed back into the cushiony leaves in an explosion of fluttering gold. The fireflies paid her no mind, orbiting around her as their dance continued.\nThe chirping of a nearby cricket made the kitten's ears perk up. Bolting upright, she scanned her surroundings with wide eyes and twitching whiskers. The insect chirped again. It was close-underneath the leaves somewhere. A sly grin stretched across the kitten's muzzle. Sitting back on her haunches, she rubbed her forepaws together. Orange sparks, matching the hue of her eyes, flickered forth from her paws. With a mew of victory, the tiny cat slapped her paws to the ground, laughing with glee as a wave of sparkling, shimmering orange light burst forth from her, throwing every single fallen leaf into the air. Her crafty cricket friend revealed himself, airborne amongst the confetti of aspen leaves.\nAs did hundreds of his musically inclined little friends.\nSuspended in the air like fireflies, the crickets all belted a ballad to bring the day to a close. Above, a chilly Fall breeze made the leaves and branches sway, casting dancing shadows between the splotches of sunlight on the ground. The black eyes that dappled the trunks of the aspens watched the spectacle unfold.\nThere was nothing ghoulish to be found in Grudgewood. Only magic. \nStill grinning from ear to furry ear, the kitten let her magic dissipate. The leaves and the crickets floated back to the earth. One of the crickets bounced against the kitten's black button nose with a chirp before following the others back into hiding. She swished her tail at the crickets in farewell. There would be much more time to play with them tomorrow.\n\\\"Hello down there, Marvela!\\\" sang a twittering voice from the treetops.\nThe kitten flicked her gaze upward to spy a rather plump eastern bluebird watching her from a hollow in one of the aspens. \\\"Good evening, Sunshine!\\\" Marvela sang back.\nSunshine preened at the feathers of his proud red chest that contrasted with the sky-blue plumage along his back. \\\"How was the hunting today?\\\" the round bird chirped.\nMarvela licked at her forepaw and rubbed it across her face to smooth her ruffled fur. \\\"It's going quite well!\\\" she said, casting a glance at the pouch she had tucked away against the roots of a nearby tree. She couldn't help but puff out her star-spotted chest at the sight. The button that held the pouch shut was nearly bursting off from all the materials the kitten had gathered.   lowered her paw from her face, and her orange eyes returned to her feathered friend above. \\\"I just need one more thing...\\\"\n\n\nSunshine's feathers ruffled when he caught her leering up at him. \\\"Now, I know that look, Marvela!\\\" he said, pouting with his pudgy cheeks puffed up. \\\"I told you I won't share any more of my beautiful feathers with you! Go ask some other bird.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, but Sunshine!\\\" Marvela purred. \\\"The spell won't be complete without a bluebird feather!\\\" She smirked knowingly at her friend. \\\"And surely yours are the prettiest feathers in the whole forest.\\\"\n\\\"No!\\\" the bird said. He waddled around in his nook until all Marvela could see of him was his stubby tail feathers sticking out. \\\"Now, goodnight.\\\"\nMarvela flicked her tail across the ground. A frown had replaced her toothy grin. \\\"That's fine, I suppose,\\\" she said as she padded over to her sack and pried it open. \\\"I guess I'll have to find some other bluebird who'd like these lovely juniper berries I found...\\\"\nShe pulled a twig from her bag and held it up between two claw-tips, watching as the sunlight gleamed off the plump purple berries on the twig.\nJust as she expected, Sunshine whirled around in his hole, his beady eyes alight as he gasped at the sight of the berries. \n\\\"J-junipers?\\\" the fat bird stammered. His hungry eyes never left the branch Marvela brandished.\n\\\"Yup!\\\" said the kitten. \\\"And they're all for you! All I need are just a few teensy little feathers from you-\\\"\n\\\"Fine!\\\" the bluebird squawked, hopping out of his hole and onto a branch. \\\"You've got a deal!\\\"\nThe bird never stopped bouncing as Marvela held the sprig between her forepaws. She closed her eyes and summoned her magic. She felt it inside her, swirling like a warm rush of wind. It grew from her heart and spread down her spine, through her limbs, and into the black pads of her paws. She opened her eyes, pleased to see the little sprig enshrouded in a golden glow. Slowly she pulled her paws away from it. And slowly, the twig rose.\nThe impatient little bird plucked the twig from the air once it reached him. Sunshine pulled a small beakful of bright orange feathers from his breast after tucking away his berries in his nest.\nThe feathers floated down from the treetops. Marvela caught them in an outstretched paw. Too easy, she thought to herself, whiskers twitching with delight.\n\\\"Thank you, Sunshine!\\\" she said, purring and tucking away the last of her ingredients into her sack. With the sounds of Sunshine munching on berries behind her, the black kitten scooped up her pouch in her teeth and skipped into the darkening forest.\nThe animals of day were tucked into their holes and nests. The creatures of night slunk out of their homes. Somewhere, an owl hooted, and another answered its call from further into the woods. Yet, every creature that lived in Grudgewood, both diurnal and nocturnal, greeted the passing kitten. Marvela happily flicked her tail at all her forest friends in return. She paused her prancing only once, when the sight of distant lights caught her attention.\nSquinting through the gaps in the trees and brambles, the kitten caught a glimpse of the world outside the forest. It was a world she had never experienced.\nBeyond the woods she was born in and down at the foot of a slope, was the little town of Vigilance. The streets were busy with cars full of people returning home. Marvela could smell the smoke from the chimneys and see the silhouettes of families settling down for the night in the buildings' lit windows. It was a strange, foreign world, and the kitten sat transfixed by the sight.\n...Until a movement in the gnarled branches above her caught her attention. She looked upwards and gasped.\nA big black bird watched her from the twisted, bare limbs of a dead aspen tree. Its dark eyes were cold and devoid of light as it glowered down at her.\n\n\nA crow.\nCrows and ravens were a common sight in the golden forest, but Marvela didn't recognize this particular bird. The kitten raised her tail to greet the newcomer, happy to meet a new face. The crow didn't share Marvela's attitude. She watched as the bird's black eyes narrowed at her. With a throaty squawk, the fowl took wing and flapped away.\n\n\n\n"}

She was the snow, and I, the wind sweeping her up. And like the snow and wind, separately we hardly made a sound\u2014we gave no trouble. But together, together...well, our paths' collision resounded as the most memorable times in our lives. We shared our food, our playthings, and sometimes our dreams. It seemed only inevitable that we'd also end up sharing a man.\nThe heavy snow outside our manor had started innocently enough. But then came the wind and no one could really say when this unruly mess took a dangerous turn. Because separately, a gentle snowfall and a delicate breeze were praiseworthy creatures. To be honest, the wind was innocent, too. As was I.\nI had not wanted this. And she hadn't known. But she was married now, though I was the one he first courted. And she was married, though I was the one he said he remained close for. And she was married, knowing how I felt. In the end, what did any of that all matter? We weren't his only conquests. The two of us just happened to be the first, and only, to give him a child.\nMother sat stoic on a large ornate chair, watching us from across the room. The flames of the lamplight danced against her face, casting her in a warm hue. It was a tender tone that stopped at her frigid scowl.\n\\\"Two days now with little progress,\\\" the midwife declared.\nSweat dripped from my brow. I could barely keep my head up. My dear sister wasn't faring well. She was in a fever, babbling throughout most of it.\nAnother sharp pain tore through me, thrusting me forward. I let it come, helpless as I waited. This was unexpected. Mine should have arrived second. Arabella's was late. But Mother watched me. At one time, that gaze fell upon me because I was her favorite. Now...now she hated me.\nI turned my head to the left to peer at my sister, perhaps for the last time. Mother wouldn't allow me to stay. It was the terrible weather why she hadn't sent me to the convent sooner. After this\u2014after my stupid mistake\u2014I'd have to go, the blizzard be damned.\n\\\"It's coming,\\\" someone announced.\nThat tingling at the base of my spine returned. I gritted my teeth as it ripped through me, and I perceived something different.\nMother's stoic expression never faltered. \\\"Best look in on her; I see the head.\\\"\nExhausted face after exhausted face turned around to see what she meant. The crowd rushed me, squawking in panic. Young midwives, they were who came to my aid. The far more experienced ones never budged from my sister's side.\nI should have focused only on the voices ordering me what to do but instead, my eyes stayed fixed on my Arabella's greying face. She was fading. And much like the snow clinging to our windows, desperate to perceive yet another day before they ultimately gave up and vanished, I feared today might greet me with both life and death.\n\\\"A girl,\\\" someone announced.\nEyes dripping with sweat, I tried to look finally. \n\\\"Bring it here,\\\" Mother ordered.\nMy struggles to sit up proved useless. I crashed back down again. The baby's cries were the sweetest sounds I had ever heard. They punctuated the panting and groans of the night, fluttering to my ears with a sweet sense of relief.\nAnd as the world dimmed, guilt came with it, for what would become of us\u2014me and this child\u2014once we were no longer safe here, hidden away in winter?\nMy lashes heavy from sweat and defeat, I lay back to take a much-needed rest. A glance at my Arabella revealed tears in her eyes when a midwife whispered to her, words too soft to reach my ears.\n\n\nI awoke to darkness in the night. Something latched to my breast. As strange as the sensation was, I was proud. In the pitch-black night, my child nursed well. So in the morning when I awoke again, I could only stare down at the still body beside me. The baby didn't move.\nMy scream awoke all who'd cared for and cleaned me in the night. An elder midwife glanced at my mother as she entered the room. They said not a word to one another.\nTrembling, I watched them, waiting for someone to do me the courtesy and speak.\nArabella stirred, her bundle tucked neatly in her arm by one of the younger midwives.\n\\\"Oh, she's lovely,\\\" Bella said, tears streaming down her face.\nAnd me? I looked at mine, feeling cheated. No movement, nothing. \n\\\"I'm sorry, miss,\\\" someone muttered, \\\"he was too weak.\\\"\nThe world faded for me when I understood those words. I'm sorry. So many months of pain and insecurity amounted to an...I'm sorry. \nTears stung my eyes, but I had no right. It hardly mattered if the wind was first or more justified to a claim. It was responsible for carrying on the new, for giving life's breath. This winter, we both failed.\n\\\"Take the body out of here,\\\" Mother instructed.\n\\\"Wait.\\\" The words came back to me and I yanked the still frame into my grip. When I uprooted the wrappings, tearing a gasp of disgust from the women around me, I beheld something far beyond my imagination. A boy. This child...was a boy. \\\"I had a girl,\\\" I insisted.\nBut when I scanned the room for any eyes that would meet mine, anyone who would corroborate my words, I found silence.\n\\\"I...I had a girl,\\\" I said again in a whisper. \n\\\"Enough!\\\" Mother bellowed. She seethed when she slammed down her cane and used it to pull her forward. Bracing herself against it, she leaned down to meet eyes with me. \\\"Filth.\\\"\nI bit back my shock.\n\\\"Your jealousy for your sister led you here. It's led you to this moment and it's led you to this fitting fate. I need not send you away now, but should you ever, ever utter such evil, malicious words again, not even in my death will you know a moment's peace.\\\"\nThis time when the shock took all sensation from me, I could not even feel when the boy was snatched from my hands, leaving me with nothing, not even a sense of false closure.\nArabella watched me from her bed. That pensive expression of hers was one I was familiar with, but today I could see the satisfaction behind it.\nBut what was I to do? Drag myself to my feet and wrestle my baby from her? Run off into the night, an unwed mother, with no home to give her?\nNo. This was mother's rescue. Even the admonishment; I saw it as such. This was better. Better for everyone. This was better even for me.\nI could pretend. The way I pretended Gareth hadn't taken what he wanted from me, finishing mere moments before he proposed to my sister, I could pretend here.\nNothing happened today. My sister welcomed a beautiful baby girl into the world. \nThat morning when the storm ebbed, I saw everything anew. Till now, I'd imagined the snow and wind moving in harmony, complementing one another, but now I recognized their competition. One had to lose.\nSo I gave in.\nShortly after, winter faded, giving way to spring's warmth, but I felt colder each day.\n\n\nMy...recovery. My recovery was fast. With this perfect family set, Arabella and Gareth both agreed to pay for my room and boarding the next city over. Mother thanked him for his generous offer.  The day I had to turn to them both, their beautiful baby held between them, and offer up my utterances of thanks, was one I'd never forget. I suspected it would haunt me until my dying day.\n\n\n\n"}
{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nSoilders in the Jungle: Kitt is a solider in the jungle. He is watching a soccer game with his friend Hin. The get called into Colonel Khamsi\u2019s office for a mission.\n\n#action, #asian, #soilder, #military, #friend, #soccer, #football, #jungle \n\nSoilders in the Jungle\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\nThe deflated football bounced off the makeshift goal post and landed in the dirt with a thud. A stream of men filed after it and a series of grunts and curses ensued as the ball was punted towards the other side of the dirt field. The players on the field were in various states of undress as they sweated in the heat of midday. Large trees lined the impromptu field, but the shade couldn't defeat the thick humidity that clung to the jungle.\nIt was a soul sucking kind of humidity. It clung to your skin and made it hard to breathe. It was a surprise none of them had drowned in the dense atmosphere. \nKitt leaned back against the tree he was sitting under and blinked the sweat from his eyes. His uniform clung to him like a body cast, and the more he sweat the worse he felt. But it could be worse. \nThe mosquitos weren't out yet. \nHe sighed and scuffed his boots in the dirt. They hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Glancing down at their scuffed leather he remembered that there was a time where he would have been bothered by their appearance. That was before. Maybe someday he would laugh about it, but right now all he wanted to do was take a cold shower and park himself in front of a fan. \nBrushing some of his dark hair from his eyes he continued watching the soccer game. Where did they get the energy? He wondered as they fumbled around the dirt patch that had been turned into their rec area. \nA canteen was pushed into his vision and he took it without a word. Hin sat down beside him and drank from his own canteen. The tepid water wasn't exactly refreshing, but it didn't hurt. \n\\\"Are you going to join?\\\" Kitt asked. \nHin didn't answer. He didn't need to. They had been friends for ten years and Kitt knew he wasn't likely to get an answer from the man. \nKitt glanced over at Hin and hated at how at ease he looked. Hin was never anything but at ease. His straight brown hair was pushed back from his face and he didn't even look like he was sweating. His angular face was calm and relaxed\u2014thin eyebrows resting above light-colored eyes that always seemed to be laughing at something. Hin enjoyed his own private jokes. \n\\\"When are you meeting with Lt. Colonel Khamsi?\\\" Hin asked after he replaced the cap on his canteen. \nKitt looked down at his own canteen and twisted his wrist to look at his watch. \\\"In a few minutes.\\\" \nHin nodded and watched the game with a disinterested expression. Kitt hated talking with the Lt. Colonel. The man never made eye contact with Kitt and had soft hands. Couldn't trust a man with soft hands. It was only a cruel twist of fate that promoted Kitt rather than Hin. The bastard had managed to slip through the cracks and now Kitt was a Sergeant and responsible for the soldiers under him. \nTwo of the players ran into each other each other and went sprawling into the dirt. The larger of the two grabbed the other and shoved his face into the dirt, cackling as the smaller man spluttered into dirt. \nThis was Kitt's crack team of soldiers. \nHe wiped his forehead with his shoulder. \\\"When was the last time you felt air conditioning?\\\" he asked Hin. \n\\\"Three hundred days, sixteen hours, forty-four minutes.\\\" He answered without pause. \n\\\"Please tell me you made that up.\\\"\n\n\nHin grinned, his straight white teeth flashing against his tanned complexion. Kitt glanced down at his watch again and pushed himself up off the small bench they had been resting on. He handed the canteen back to Hin and buttoned the last two buttons on his uniform jacket. The sleeves were rolled up to his elbows and he had no intention of pulling them down, meeting with his superior or not. \nSlim fingers reached up and fixed his collar and he smacked them away. Hin huffed a laugh and stood up next to him. He was about the same height as Kitt, but slender. As a kid he had been skinny and awkward looking, but he grew into his height and filled out enough. Hin was a good-looking man but tended to intimidate people with his silence and unblinking stares. \nKitt could feel a drip of sweat make its way down his back.\nAt least the Lt. Colonel had a fan in his office. \nHin trailed behind Kit as he walked up the small trail from the rec field to the main camp. \nCamp might be a strong word for it. Camp implies that there was some sort of organization and planning. In reality, the camp was a mass of thick canvas tents that had probably been in some sort of pattern at the beginning but as things were added on it became a jumbled mess. It took new people weeks to find their way around. \nAllegedly the camp was mobile, but no one had ever tested that out. \nThe Lt. Colonel's tent was north of where they were playing football. Its only distinguishing feature was the small sign stuck into the dirt out front that read 'Commanding Officer' in faded white paint. Kitt stepped up to the door and knocked. \nA sharp voice called him in, and he took a deep breath before opening the thin wooden door and stepping into the dimly lit tent. \nDespite the oscillating fan sitting on the Lt. Colonel's desk, it was still stifling in the small tent. Kitt's boots brushed against the wooden floor of the tent as the flimsy door slammed behind him. Despite being sparsely decorated the tent looked cluttered. A utilitarian looking metal desk was pushed to the center of the room and a filing cabinet rested against the far wall. Three maps were stuck to corkboard behind the desk and a globe was resting on top of the filing cabinet. \nThere was a running bet as to the function of the globe, but so far no one had found out why it was actually there. Personally, Kitt thought it was so that they would never forget that there was a bigger world out there. It was so easy to get stuck within the confines of their remote camp that it was good to have a reminder that there was something beyond the heat and mosquitos.\n\\\"Have a seat Sergeant Ayuyen.\\\" Lt. Colonel Khamsi gestured to one of the uncomfortable chairs placed in front of his desk. \nKitt nodded and took a seat. He was used to Khamsi's brusque way of speaking to him. The man had no time for idle talk. Kitt didn't actually mind the man, he was fine for a CO, but he had a hard time pinning him down. Every time Kitt thought he had a personality pegged, Khamsi surprised him.\nThe Lt. Colonel was currently signing paperwork. There was a large pile of folders on his desk that ruffled ominously every time the oscillating fan turned toward the pile. \nKitt's attention was on the fan itself. He counted the seconds until it turned toward him again, the cool air brushing against his face and giving him blessed relief. He was happy to sit in the tent as long as Khamsi wanted him to, as long as that fan turned toward him every 38 seconds. \nFinally, he gathered up the paperwork and aggressively squared the sheets together before dropping them into the over full out box on the right hand corner of his desk.\n\n\nThe silence stretched between them. The Lt. Colonel seemed irritated. His thick black eyebrows normally hovered precariously close to each other but today they were one long line on his forehead. In his mid-forties, Khamsi had been career military since he was young. He took his service very seriously, though on the outset he seemed to be a lax leader that was disinterested in the workings of his command, he delegated well and trusted the men he put in charge. It was the kind of leadership that couldn't be taught and had to be learned.\n There was a simple gold band on his left ring finger finger and Kitt wondered what kind of woman would marry the Lt.Colonel. He was a fine enough man, Kitt supposed, though he doubted he was ever handsome--his dark skin was heavily wrinkled, and he was quite hairy. \nJoom said he saw him in the showers once. The man had refused to shower for weeks after that. \nKitt tried not to think about it. \n\\\"This was not my idea.\\\" Khamsi said with a sigh. He shuffled through the folders on his desk and pulled one from the middle of the stack. Reaching across the desk he handed it to Kitt. \nKitt took it but didn't open it yet. \\\"Not your idea, sir?\\\"\n\\\"No. Actually I was very against it. But it's above my paygrade.\\\" \nHe glanced down at the manila folder in his hands and flipped open the front cover. The first page was a personnel form with an attached visa permit. \n\n\n\n"}

However, it didn't stop them from persisting and persevering, glowing against all odds, as they continued to sparkle for millennia, and watched the earth grow. \nThe angels watched the earthlings from among the stars too. More specifically, they watched the humans, for it was the humans that lived among creatures that were far more powerful than they'd ever be but still claimed dominance across the planet. \nIf there was one thing about the humans, however, it was that they no longer believed in the stars. \nThey didn't believe in the hidden wisdom of the skies, and they didn't believe that they had their own stories written in the stars and interwoven through the fabrics of space-time.\nTo them, the study of the skies was a mere science, and stars were but mere orbs of glowing dust and gas. In reality, they were the culmination of centuries, if not millennia of years of the work of not only gravity but also fate. They were wiser than you'd give them any credit for.\nThe stars had watched as the earth grew. They had watched as darkness bloomed. They had watched the plunder and flourish, the rise and fall, the evolution and extinction. They had watched as the earth continued to be littered by the ruins of empires that believed they were eternal.\nFor all this transpired underneath the same skies, skies that were as old as time. \nAnd underneath those same starry skies, there stood a man.\nOne hand was pressed against his abdomen as he staggered, while the other was reaching into his pockets, frantically scrabbling around for something, anything, that could help him. \n\\\"C'mon,\\\" he murmured to himself through clenched teeth, hissing out a pained breath, \\\"c'mon, c'mon, c'mon-\\\"\nWhen he finally felt something cool against his palm, he heaved a tiny sigh of relief. His shaking fingers pulled the phone out while trying to blink away the black spots that were threatening to obscure his vision, but just as his fingers dialed an emergency contact, the screen went black.\nA tiny loading icon appeared in the middle. \nDead. \nHis eyes widened. \\\"No,\\\" his fingers were shaking, but that didn't stop them from desperately trying to turn the phone back on. \\\"Shit- no, no, no- c'mon-\\\"\nThe ground underneath him began to tilt.\nThe waves of dizziness were becoming stronger. He was becoming weaker.\n\n\nThe phone slipped from his grasp clattering onto the ground next to him, as his knees buckled.\n\\\"Fuck,\\\" a hiss left his mouth the moment his knees touched the ground, and his arm wobbled, his muscles screaming in protest as they tried to support him.\nBut this didn't stop the crimson from seeping between his fingers, staining the emerald grass red- as the dark liquid continued to unforgivingly spill from circular wounds in his abdomen. \nBlood. \nHe wasn't unfamiliar with its metallic scent.\nHe had blood on his own hands. Both literally, and metaphorically. \nAs one of the best hitmen to ever exist, with aim and precision so sharp that he was even nicknamed The Falcon, it was common knowledge that he had great reflexes and an incredibly alert mind. So how had he missed this?\nHe was supposed to be strong. \nHe was supposed to be alert. He should have been alert. \nBut two bullets to the stomach from an unsuspecting assailant had rendered him immobile.\nHis body had twitched in shock at the impact, his fumbling fingers reaching for his waistband- where he usually kept his gun, but he never felt the familiar cool metal underneath the skin of his palm. His eyes had swept the darkness around him, desperate to see someone lurking between the trees- but the black dots that began to cloud his vision didn't allow it. \nIn all the desperate searching, he could've sworn that there was a pair of gleaming orbs watching him, watching as he struggled, relishing as he tried to cling to the last moments of his life. Even in that hazy state, a part of him wondered if he was imagining it- \nBecause those eyes were a bright, gleaming red. A glowing crimson, shining in the dark.\nEvery time he thought he saw them, they disappeared.\nIs this what blood loss did to you? Did it make you hallucinate demonic eyes? \nHe squeezed his eyes shut, trying to dismiss the images. There was already a problem at hand, he didn't need others to mess with his brain more than that.\nBut he was growing weaker and weaker by the second. His arms could barely hold him up any longer, and his legs refused to co-operate to help him stand.\nOnly seconds had passed, but to his body, those mere specks of time- insignificant to most, felt stretched. His arms trembled, as they gave away, making him collapse face-first into the grass. \nThe world around him numbed. The only sound that his ears could hear other than a harsh ringing, was the wavering thump of his heart, and the blood rushing through his body.\nLuck was not on his side today. Not only had he left his weapon behind while venturing out alone, but his own phone had betrayed him too. He was at least a mile away from any civilization, so no one would find him. At least, no one that could help him.\nIt took him more effort than anything he had done in his life, but he forced his hands to push the ground, slowly flipping himself around, so he was lying on his back. The hand above the two bullet wounds shook, as he pressed them- but it didn't stop the blood from continuing to flow.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut once more, taking in a lungful of air. Petrichor. That's what the earth around him smelled like.\nWhen he opened his eyes again, to look back up, the stars of the night sky twinkled back at him.\nIt was almost like the sight of them was some sort of trigger.\nBecause the fight in his muscles died. The will to live in his heart faded. \nA sadness, almost pitiful took its place.\nHe'd never see his little brother again. He'd never see Corban, or Gale, or any of them either. They'd never see him alive again too.\nHe would see his mum again, though. The thought brought a small smile to his face, a trickle of blood trailing down past his lips, as he coughed.\nBut this was it. This was how he was meant to die. The fact that nothing had gone his way, was no coincidence- it was written in the stars, it had to be. \nAnd thus, all he could do was continue to stare at the dark sky and watch with almost sad eyes, the slow dance of the infinite stars, as he tried to commit them to his memory. His eyes drifted across the patterns as he tried to decipher them past his blurry vision, murmuring their names to himself, one last time.\n\\\"Orion...\\\"\nThe stars. They were always constant. \n\\\"C-Canis...\\\"\nThe world was dynamic- people came and left, each day was different from the previous and the next, and they soon grew into passing memories.

What a page turner, right? Even as I realize my story fully, I sit in the Mighty Throne of Zeus himself, the ruled and king of the Grecian Gods of Old. You see, I used to actually be one of them until my life was ripped apart in front of me. I was a Grecian Goddess but don't try looking me up. I'm not one that you would recognize. You see, I'm the absolute embodiment of Mischievous Nature and Pandemonium.\n\nBut as I stand over the land I once conquered, I fear that my time is nearly over so I had better let you in on how I got this far. Welcome to the Land of Veilarya. I hope you find an adventure here.\n\nChapter 2\n\nMy tale begins on a dark and stormy night. Clich\u00e9, right? The rain was pounding against my bare skin as if it had solidified into hail within a moment before hitting it. The sky above was swirling with black clouds, the birds flying around trying to find cover from the near hurricane-category storm. A strong smell of sea salt sprayed through the air like the foam from the tips of the waves just before they splattered into the rocks just ahead of the beach. The atmosphere was livid with emotions, crashing every which way to find an escape from the confines of this Earth.\nI stood at the base of the waves, standing just outside of my car that I had driven just to the base of this cliff-like rock. I stood at the edge of the rock, contemplating the world and ignoring the never ending buzz of my phone beside me. I held on to it just enough that it wouldn't go falling into the ferocious waves below. \nMy entire life had been dedicated to the sea and its beauties deep below. All I'd thought about was the carefree nature of its currents that pushed at the unwelcome humans that had waded too far. Even now as I stared at the storm that should've been completely terrifying in front of me I just wanted to grab my surfboard and dive into the spiraling waves below. \nThe rage that had brought me here had begun to dissipate until the phone buzzed again, revealing my mother's ringtone. My hand clenched around the phone and in a moment of pure anger I had wound my arm back and launched the phone into a rising wave that wet my face and doused my feet. It hit the water with a loud SPLASH and within seconds I was sent sprawling when the phone was launched back at me, hitting me in the forehead and causing me to fall onto my back on the wet rock. I looked back to the wave which, if for a second, looked like it had a man standing just off of the edge of the rock, then back down to my phone. When I looked back up to double check what I'd just seen, the figure was gone and I was left alone on the slick surface of the rock again. \nAs I stood back up I was beginning to hear sirens in the distance as they only seemed to get closer. Was that one, two, three, four cop cars careening towards me at this ungodly hour? I'd had a single car come to get me from the beach before but I'd never seen four coming to get me? Was my mom and dad okay? How about Alexander? Instead of just four cop cars, though, I heard the terrible screeching of breaks that were just now breaking. I looked up and felt a piercing pain run through my body, throwing me back a little bit. I groaned, sitting up as I didn't realize what had happened yet. I looked down for a moment to see a bar had pierced through my stomach, which was now bleeding out a lot. Fear and shock ran rampant through my veins as I shakily tried to get to my feet, to figure out exactly what had just happened.\n\n\n\n"}

The wiper blades darted across the windshield glass, viciously driving away the streamlets of water in almost perfect timing to the rhythm echoing in Shannon's mind. \nBang. Treble-and-a-toe. Click-up-down. Treble-and-a-toe\u2014flick-heel-step. And one-two-three. And one-two-three. Brush-one-two-three-four. And click-through and click-through\u2014step down.\nHer father turned onto Stockland Hill Road as the wind picked up and drove a shower of droplets towards them, the squeaking wipers quickening in pace to clear visibility. A car passed them on the country road, muddy water spraying behind him, the only other sound besides the rain on the windows and the slight wush of the air conditioning. For it was only in her mind that brush and clicking of hard shoes continued, memories just out of reach taunting her consciousness.\u00a0\nShannon straightened in her seat, her spine crackling as it twisted back into shape. Outside, brown and green fields\u2014mostly brown\u2014raced by, the distance hidden behind the misty curtain and dark clouds. The rain had begun the moment they flew over England that morning. Not that it surprised her. It had always rained whenever she'd been in England before to compete in the Great Britain Championships. She had, however, never expected to actually call this place home, even if her dad was from here.\u00a0\nBut then, she had never expected all that had happened in the last five months to ever take place.\nThose five months seemed almost a lifetime ago.\nA graveyard. Crumbling headstones as ancient as the eighteenth century and the polished granite of modern ones. And in between them one newly placed. \nStage lights. Dazzling and reflecting off myriads of Swarovski crystals as accordion music echoed in the background. Numbness nearly suffocating her as she watched and waited for her turn.\u00a0\u00a0\nHer best friend's birthday party. A bittersweet celebration.\u00a0\nA moving truck. Men carrying out boxes for international shipping as Shannon stood on the porch with a coat on, hopelessly lost. \nOddly enough, it was the rain that connected them all. \nAnd it was raining still. \nShannon glanced out the window to her right as her dad switched onto a new road. They had been driving for over three hours now since they'd arrived at the London City Airport. Dusk was falling\u2014if dusk it could be called when the sun had never shown its face that day.\n\\\"Hey Da, how much farther is it?\\\" she piped up, breaking the silence that had fallen between them since they had left the airport with their suitcases. She wondered dolefully for a moment how long it would take for their other belongings to ship. Home, wherever it was to be, would not be the same without those things.\n\n\\\"About fifteen minutes, I think. It's hard to tell with the weather like this. Many of these country roads are little more than mud with so much rain.\\\" \nShannon did not reply. Jet lag was catching up with her and she struggled to keep her eyes open\u2014not to mention the pitter-patter against the glass made her even more sleepy.\nOutside, trees stood by the road, marking smaller driveways branching off and leading to quaint country houses nearly hidden by the dripping foliage. They passed a holiday park and then small communities flashed by, interspersed with fields and meadows.\nAlmost there, whispered a small voice in her mind.\u00a0\nAlmost where, though? It's not home. Home is back there, across the Atlantic. Home is where Mom is, where Christine is. It's not here, not in this rainy, dreary countryside.\u00a0\nShannon looked away from the window and closed her eyes, giving in to the urge to sleep and rest her mind. Yet every time she shut out the world around her, the past came rushing back, unbidden and unwanted. Memories turned into nightmares hovering somewhere between subconsciousness and reality, only vanishing in the depth of dreamless sleep.\u00a0\n\\\"Shan, I've decided that it's best for us to make a new start,\\\" Da had said. \\\"With Mom gone, we should begin again. I know it's been hard for you\u2014it's been hard for us both, but I think this move will be good for us. We have family over there, and there'll be more opportunities for us.\\\"\nShe had not replied.\nAfter all, what good would it have done to cause a fuss? It had already been decided without her input and besides, it might be a good change. But on the other hand, was she ready to give up everything and everyone she had known?\nThe car jostled its way over a pothole and Shannon's eyes flew open. The rain lessened to a fine mist as her dad pulled into a small driveway. Beside them stood a row of houses resembling the cottages used as filming locations in British period dramas.\u00a0\nHer dad parked behind one of these houses and took the keys out of the ignition, turning to look at his daughter and giving her a tired smile. \\\"We're here, Shan. What do you think?\\\" \nShe gazed outside, seeing only drab whitewash and windows overlooking the small ally. Greenery bowed down by the rain drooped sorrowfully, as if lamenting a great loss. It all looked dreary in the wet darkness and it was hard not to burst into tears. \nIt'll look alright in the morning. It always does, as Mom used to say. You're just tired from the trip. It'll be better after a good night's sleep. \nShe swallowed hard and answered in as steady of a voice as she could muster, \\\"It looks nice. Which one is ours?\\\" \n\\\"The one at the far end. C'mon, let's go take a look around before heading to Grandma's for the night,\\\" he replied, zipping up his raincoat and stepping out. \nShannon waited a moment before opening the door, almost flinching when the cold rain kissed her hand. Grabbing her phone and sticking it in her pocket, she closed the car door and followed her dad. \nHe led the way up to the back entrance of the house, fiddling with his keys for a moment before unlocking the door. He held it open as she stepped inside, closing out the icy wind. \nIt was dark in the corridor save where dim light came through the glass of the front door at the opposite end, and the house felt rather damp. Shannon blinked hard when her dad flipped on the lights, seeing only a cobblestone floor and bare white-washed walls leading in front of them. A few doorways branched off into other rooms, all empty and cold.\n\n\nHer dad stepped through one of these and turned the lights on, revealing a quaint, old-fashioned kitchen with blue and white tiling, like something out of a children's book. \n\\\"Well, at least the lights work, right?\\\" he said, attempting to lighten the mood. \\\"Feel free to explore and look around,\\\" he added, pulling out his phone. \\\"I'm going to call my parents and let them know we'll be arriving soon.\\\"\nShannon glanced around the kitchen and then back at the hall before shivering a little. So this is home? she thought as she stepped into the gloom beyond the kitchen. Of course, the house would look better once their furniture had arrived, but as it was, the emptiness was depressing, an echo of the grieving void in her heart.\u00a0\nDown the corridor and to the right, an archway opened into what she supposed was a sort of living room. It was hard to tell in the dark, and she did not know where the light switch was. Directly across from the front door, a flight of stairs led to the upper floor. \nGazing for a moment at the light spilling out from the kitchen, Shannon gripped the rail to the staircase hard and ascended, the stairs slightly creaking as she went up. \nThe floors never groaned like this at home in America; she did not like the idea of living in a place that sounded like a haunted house. What sort of ghosts might inhabit a row house this old?\u00a0\nAbove, it was so dark that she could barely see anything. If not for the light in the corridor below and the whitish glare of the streetlamp outside, she would not have found the switch without tripping and falling in the dark. \nIn a moment, the hallway was filled with a cheery yellow glow that illuminated dust in the worn cracks in the floor. There were four doors, identical to the ones on the lower floor, and a window both at the front of the hallway and at the back, squares of black to the outside world. The empty, cold air did nothing to make it feel more comfortable. Shannon's skin prickled in goosebumps at the loneliness of it all.\u00a0\nStepping forward, she opened the door nearest to her and flipped on the lights. It was a simple bedroom with the same old wood flooring and white-washed walls. A window stared out to the side, a faint glow shining through the uncurtained glass.\u00a0\nThe light on the ceiling burned out with a high plink and the bedroom was left in darkness. Shannon's heart jumped into her throat and she swallowed against the panic rising in her chest.\nJust a lightbulb. Lightbulbs burn out all the time, especially in houses like this. It's fine.\nThen why did it not feel fine?\n\n\n\n"}

A hunchback who lived in the valley gave her a dress to wear that she loved. \n\n#ogre, #fairy, #fairytale, #fantasy, #magic, #ogre\n\nThe Ogre\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nOne day, the sky grumbled a low guttural howl, let out a cackle, ripped its chest open, and bled water over the valley.\nFanli sat at the mouth of her cave, watching the dark clouds swirl together. To all others, there was black upon black perhaps, but the world of an ogre was filled with color.\nShe could see each swish and swirl, each bruising as the clouds clashed. It was when they rolled together that the rain fell harder.\nThe flashes of lightning had her drawing in a deep sigh.\nIt was beautiful. At her back, her family's noisy dinner commenced.\nWith the new ruling spreading across the land, more and more caves bordering hers rang of complaints much like her father's and mother's.\n\\\"No more human meat!\\\" her father's voice thundered and the sky lit up on cue.\nSitting here and watching the rain helped drown out the anger and rage wafting through their home.\nA foot came into view, then another. Despite her sister, Bati's larger and more enviable size, she tucked herself small.\nFanli found herself doing the same, but the broad body of an ogre didn't allow her to manage it for long.\nBati kept on. Her tusks gleamed, and she wore something Fanli hardly saw in this cave\u2014a smile.\n\\\"Looking forward to the watering hole afer this?\\\"\nIt was a tease, and a proper rude one. Said watering hole was visible even from here.\nToday, too, the strange happenings drew their focus.\nFar below, at the bottom of their hill, a little boy sat in the rain, throwing rocks at the lake. This wasn't his first or only time doing it and it made Fanli and her sister curious.\nOnce or twice, Fanli thought he was a fairy, as fairy loved rainfall, but he never flew, and he never danced. Instead, he only sat, wafting stone after stone. It was a strange thing.\nThe ruckus behind them didn't calm. In fact, it intensified.\nMother cautioned against defying the magistrate's rulings. Things had been fair and calm for near ten years now. Ogres were no longer hunted for sport by brownies or anyone else. \\\"Instead of a small handful of us, we dotted throughout several valleys in high numbers. And all it requires is to forgo gamy human meat.\\\"\nBati glanced at Fanli and their eyes met.\nFew words ever needed uttered between them.\n\\\"He won't take on a second wife,\\\" Bati assured her. \\\"You don't have to worry.\\\"\nKnees to her chest, Fanli smoothed out her gossamer dress and lied, \\\"I'm not.\\\"\nThe next crack of thunder and lightning masked their father's strike well.\nIt wasn't about peace and solace, Father'd argued. It was about tradition and pride. \nMother's fist landed on her target as well. To hell with tradition. Give our people life.\nThe back and forth went on and Fanli and her sister listened while keeping focused on the rain falling in tandem with the blows. They'd keep on like that until both tired.\nA glance in the distance at other ogre children slowly making their way out from their caves to take interest in the rain, made Fanli wonder if this normal was normal for everyone.\nSomething touching her shoulder certainly was not. Bati took her into a half hug.\nFanli looked up at her, confused. Affection like this was a strange human habit.\n\n\\\"What are you doing?\\\"\nBati didn't regard her. Instead, she stared ahead and spoke with confidence. \\\"It feels strange at first to get a hug, but you'll get used to it. Just wait.\\\"\nBut after sitting there for five minutes and attracting more than one group of curious eyes peering at them, Fanli never felt that comfort.\nShe was slow to break her sister's hold.\nAn awkward silence lulled between them until a body slammed into the cave wall and fell forward. They both glanced back to see their mother hefting the club.\nFather stood and charged, snatching it out of her hands before she had time to react. The strike then had both sisters finding interest in the stone below them, their mother's broken tusk landing mere inches away.\nGut roiling, Fanli gripped the ledge and jumped down.\n\\\"Fan!\\\"\n\\\"I'll play in the rain,\\\" she lied. \\\"Tell them I fell down.\\\"\nFate or by chance, she slipped and took a tumble. Usually, she would not care, but the state of her dress interested her greatly. It was a gift from the hunchback's wife.\nOnce Fanli pulled herself out from the mud, she was heartbroken to see her outfit ruined. But then a thought occurred, and she smiled. \nShe could get a new one. Half stumbling, half falling down the mount, she kept on until she reached the bottom of the valley.\nHigh above, the lightning weakened, the thunder cooed, and the clouds took to resting.\n\\\"No, not yet,\\\" Fanli pleaded. She let out a terrible stomp, not as thunderous as a fully grown ogre, as she raced on.\nThe last raindrop fell as soon as the back of her hand met the door.\nFanli's heart sank into the ground with it.\nThe wood pulled away and a pair of curious blue eyes greeted her.\nEmbarrassed, she scrambled for a lie, but the man instead offered, \\\"Lost your way in the rain, little ogre? Well, that's all right. Come in. Dinner's soon.\\\"\nHe still didn't know her. It was no secret it was hard to tell ogres apart, but she'd been here often enough that the man should know.\nIn the distance, two children ran around the table, making an awful ruckus.\nFanli couldn't mask her disappointment. Even here, there was no silence. She turned to leave but a voice called with a laugh, \\\"Fanli! Look at you. Wen, Ven, go greet her. And it's good that you've come, I've got another dress for you to try!\\\" The hunchback's wife hurried away, muttering, \\\"Wen simply won't wear it so it's good that you will. Come in. Come in. I've even saved you some grubs.\\\"\nThe warmth of the welcome sent the world into vivid colors. Despite the darkness outside, inside was alight with yellows and blues. Not from the scenery, but from the people.\n\\\"I'm sorry to impose, miss,\\\" Fanli muttered.\nThe twins turned and rushed her. Vedel was the boy and Wennie was the girl. No one ever guessed because she always insisted on looking identical to her twin brother. As such, they both had short hair, they both fought often, and they both wore trousers cut off at the knees.\nSuch luck. Because their mother loved making sweet dresses no one would ever wear.\nTrue to her word, the hunchback's wife returned with not one, but three lovely frocks of vivid coloring.\nFanli's body warmed but not at the gift, at the colors of the gesture. Objects of genuine meaning retained the glow of that base magic, no matter its original owner. In the hands of an ogre, it became enchanted. This was called ogre treasure and it was rare. Few people ever gifted an ogre something directly.\n\n\nOne dress shined brightest and Fanli wondered why.\nWen's voice cut her off. \\\"Never. Absolutely never,\\\" she vowed.\nHer mother, having offered one of the duller dresses over, cleared her throat, embarrassed.\nFor Fanli, however, that glowing dress was all she cared about. \\\"What's this on' made of, miss?\\\" she inquired.\nThe hunchback's wife put the dresses on the table. \\\"The same as the others of course. Here.\\\"\nUpon receiving the present, it shined brighter and Fanli understood. The size was big, but the other two were small, meant for a human child.\nDoubtful but touched, Fanli asked, \\\"Did you make this for me, miss?\\\"\nShe scoffed. \\\"Why, of course I did. You can only use Wen's ones if you take human form. That's not really fair, is it?\\\" Hands on her hips, she studied the remaining dresses. \\\"I suppose I can combine these two into one for you.\\\"\nEyes still fixed on the dress in her hands, Fanli snapped her head up. A gift regifted had no glow. Taking something meant for another would preserve its original enchantment, but not if it was reformed and handed off to her.\n\\\"Oh, no, ma'am. I'm happy to take human form. It's good practice.\\\" Always cautious of her manners around humans, Fanli risked shifting her gaze to the right to Wen who watched them. \\\"Unless you think you'll want it later.\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

Find the right one, and a marvellous adventure shall follow. Sir Ferrante Rastelli, the Paladin of the Order of Verity, didn't resent the Dames. He resented the inevitability of being put onto the collision course with them.\n\u00a0Take today as an example. He bent his head low to dive inside the inn, bracing for the smell of fried onions, sour ale and wet wool, and it didn't disappoint. The unsavory yet comforting combination triggered a rumble in his gut as if by magic. By the Light, he wished the day was done, so he could eat, then stretch out on a cot, and slip into oblivion.\nBut he had to greet the Dame first. Dame, then food. Then... well, that depended entirely on what the Dame had to say.\nSquinting from the cooking smoke, he surveyed the cavernous interior for his charge.\nThere she was.\nYoung... two brown braids hang down her back, pink blush on her cheeks even in the dim light... yes, young, but that passes. She faced the door, her back to the wall. Her cloak was strung over the back of her chair, allowing him a good look at her boiled leather armor with metal bands, all in excellent condition, but not brand new. She was humble then, when the astounding number of the green knights were full of piss and bluster.\nShe spotted him right away, not a big accomplishment given his height, but didn't cry out, or (Light forbid!) rush at him with the salutations. The tavern seemed in good repair, so she hadn't started a brawl to prove she was a wild harridan either. Maybe this one had a pleasant, even temperament for a change.\nHmm... he rubbed his closely cropped beard. Dames were dicey, so he should still stay on guard, despite the favourable first impressions.\nYet, he wasn't helping anything by standing in the doors like a boulder. After taking a deep breath in, Ferrante crossed the rush-strewn floor in three giant strides, and plopped into the chair next to her. It screeched under the combined weight of his bulk and armour, but didn't wobble.\nThe Dame held her ground too. Her eyes travelled to the badge with the red gladiolus pinned to his cloak, then to his forehead. \\\"Fair Light, Sir Ferrante.\\\"\nHe extended his hand, feeling strangely unsettled by her excellent manners. \\\"Well met, Dame Elvira. My apologies for being delayed en route. I trust your accommodations have been adequate?\\\"\nHer eyes crinkled at the corners. \\\"After the forest floor, a sack of hay is a luxury, Sir.\\\"\n\\\"Ain't that Light's whole truth!\\\" he roared up, delighted with how firm her handshake was.\n\\\"I trust your delay served to right a wrong,\\\" Elvira said. Her voice was a study in politeness, but it had an edge that put Ferrante on the defensive.\n\\\"A missing boy,\\\" he said, indicating the height just above the tabletop with his hand. \\\"But do not let the tender age fool you.\\\"\n\\\"Oh?\\\" Her mouth and her eyes rounded up at the promise of a tale.\nThe fatigue of a few moments ago evaporated. Appreciative audience was a lure he could never pass up. He launched into his tale with relish. \\\"After the tearful mother begged me to search for whatever monsters had him, the village mayor begged me no less tearfully to leave the hellion to his fate, for after his father's death he'd become the terror of the community.\\\"\n\\\"No! Surely nobody would ask a paladin of the Order of the Valiant Heart to abandon a child to the werewolves or other abominations!\\\" she exclaimed half in outrage, half-laughing, guessing by his expression at the happy outcome. \\\"But the story ended in a rescue?\\\"\nFerrante leaned forward in his chair, to keep the story between them. \\\"Dame, the hellion led me on the chase for three days until I was ready to appreciate the mayor's point of view.\\\"\n\n\\\"Yet you didn't give up, good Sir?\\\" Elvira asked breathlessly.\n\\\"Nay. I contrived the ruse of pretending to be asleep.\\\"\n\\\"How cunning!\\\"\n\\\"Indeed. Then I waited for my quarry to come nigh, intending to steal food from my saddlebags or even my horse. That's when I pounced...\\\"\nFerrante imitated his lunge. \\\"Faster than this, of course.\\\"\n\\\"I imagine you had to be, Sir.\\\"\u00a0 That foxy grin on her face was the most beautiful thing he'd seen in weeks. In his whole life, maybe.\n\\\"I caught him!\\\" Ferrante nearly jumped up from his chair, the yesterday's excitement coursing through his veins. \\\"Between kicking my shins, the miscreant admitted his intention to join the bandits. Fortunately, I apprehended him before the outlaws did.\\\"\n\\\"Did the mayor have a change of heart when he saw the poor widow reunited with her lost lamb?\\\" Elvira inquired after clapping her hands soundlessly to his heroism.\n\\\"Oh, how I wish it was what had happened. Alas, I thanked the Light for being armoured when I rode through the village, the boy on my saddle. The Mayor's eviscerating gaze... ugh.\\\" He pretended to shiver.\nA small crease formed between Elvira's arching brows. \\\"Well done, Sir, but wouldn't the boy just run off again?\\\"\n\\\"That I cannot know, Dame. However, I gave my word as a paladin, to take him on as a squire of the Order, if upon my return I hear nothing but glowing accounts of his comportment.\\\"\n\\\"And you intend to keep your word!\\\" she exclaimed with such joy that Ferrante blushed.\u00a0\n\\\"It's the only honourable recourse.\\\" Really, after he told it, the adventure seemed trite and not at all worthy of telling. Neither he earned the admiration or should have even attempted to court it.\u00a0\nThe chair groaned as he fidgeted. \\\"Ah... Forgive me my tardiness. As a knight, you do the kind errands like that, and know how they could take more time than expected.\\\"\n\\\"Aye, it is the very purpose of the knight errant,\\\" Elvira said with a flicker of pride in her eyes. \\\"To do the good deeds wherever we happen upon a need, no matter how small.\\\"\n\\\"I miss it,\\\" Ferrante heard himself saying wistfully. She was damnably easy to talk to.\nShe smiled in response, showing teeth like seed pearls, another point in her favour. \\\"Then I'm glad you're late for our meeting, Sir.\\\"\nThe meeting! How did it slip his mind?\u00a0He couldn't be mopping when there was a quest she needed the Order's help with, and him being late as is. He cleared his throat. \\\"Could you apprise me of your quest?\\\"\nThe Dame straightened, visibly nervous. \\\"Sir, a necromancer set himself up on the old Imperial battlefield. There is a fort nearby where a legion was apparently slaughtered in antiquity.\\\"\nFerrante nodded. The Ordovici sowed the land thick with the old bones and weapons of war. There was once a fort on every suitable hill. Now... only wind whistled between the crumbling stones. Stones and ghosts...\n\\\"Is he raising ghosts,\u00a0 your necromancer?\\\"\n\\\"Aye. He was quite harmless for a time, just conferring with the restless souls at twilight. Then he'd get drunk and pass out. It escalated when he abducted the miller's daughter.\\\"\n\\\"And he got himself an anchor...\\\" Ferrante guessed.\n\\\"Aye,\\\" Elvira confirmed, then blushed fiercely. \\\"The maiden is unharmed, for our necromancer is a burned-out wick... as a man.\\\"\n\n\\\"Yes, I follow.\\\"\n\\\"He uses her to anchor the ghosts in the sunlit world. I can dispatch the ghosts, Sir, but a sword is no use in freeing someone from a possession.\\\"\n\\\"And he just brings them back through her,\\\" Ferrante finished her report for her. It sounded like the Dame's necromancer had some pull with the Pits of Doom. \\\"You did right to appeal to the Order for help.\\\"\nShe chewed the inside of her cheek. \\\"Sir, you came alone. Is it... ah... sufficient?\u201d\n\n\n\n"}

gave a reassuring wave and, with the tips of her fingers, tugged the kite from the tree's grasp.\u00a0 She swung down over the edge of the building roof with one hand to the wooden balcony below, then used her qinggong to descend gracefully, her feet lightly touching the ground below.\u00a0 She paused to pluck an offending leaf from the wooden frame of the toy, then walked forward to meet the small crowd that had formed while she was performing her feat of acrobatics. \nMing Yue returned the kite to its grateful owner, then sent the boy on his way with a gentle pat on the head.\u00a0 As the crowd dispersed, she turned away, and the smile on her full-lipped mouth faded quickly.\u00a0 Instead, a worried frown drew her delicately arched brows downwards towards her hazel eyes, temporarily marring the features of her beautiful face. \nJing Yi, her personal maid and long-time friend, touched the princess's shoulder gently in understanding.\n\\\"Don't worry too much about His Majesty, Ming Yue,\\\" she said.\u00a0 \\\"He is used to dealing with these complicated political matters.\\\"\nMing Yue gave her friend a grateful look but, in her heart, she knew that this time was different.\nMing Yue's father, the king of Jin, had been troubled recently.\u00a0 The tenuous peace between Jin and the neighbouring kingdom of Han was on the verge of collapse.\u00a0 Jin spies outside the palace walls in Han were reporting distressing rumours that influential people in King Xuanming's inner circle were whispering in his ear, sowing seeds of distrust and suspicion between the two kingdoms.\u00a0 Even now, King Hu\u00ecw\u00e9n was locked away with his advisers, trying to think of ways to maintain the fragile harmony that had been achieved at great cost on both sides.\n\\\"Our relationship with Han has never been good,\\\" acknowledged King Hu\u00ecw\u00e9n, \\\"and I was aware of the small skirmishes at the borders every now and then.\u00a0 But I had believed that, for now, it was stable.\u00a0 Clearly the situation is much more sensitive than I had originally thought.\u00a0 Does anyone have any recommendations?\\\"\n\\\"Your Majesty\\\", said a senior official, \\\"if it is accurate that some of King Xuanming's own counsellors are responsible for this change of heart then it is difficult for us to confront the matter directly with the king.\u00a0 Also, these rumours are unconfirmed.\u00a0 If none of it is true, then we risk angering Han Kingdom over nothing.\\\" \nKing Hu\u00ecw\u00e9n nodded.\n\\\"I agree,\\\" he said.\u00a0 \\\"Our first priority should be establishing whether there is any truth to the stories.\u00a0 Only then can we make a decision on the best course of action.\u00a0 The question is, how do we do this without Han Kingdom's knowledge?\u00a0 Our spies outside of the Han palace can only do so much without access to the Han royal court.\\\"\nThe king's most trusted confidante, Military Adviser Yu Long, stepped forward. \n\\\"I may have an idea,\\\" he said, slowly.\u00a0 \\\"There is a family in the Han capital who have been settled there for many years, since well before the war, but they remain loyal to Jin, the birthplace of the family patriarch.\\\"\u00a0 He continued.\n\\\"The second daughter of the family is currently a maidservant in the inner palace.\u00a0 However, she has recently been struck down by an illness which my spies tell me has affected a number of young people throughout the capital, meaning that there is a shortage of palace staff and replacements are urgently needed.\u00a0 The family matriarch, whilst not of noble blood, is respected and known to the most senior palace housekeepers.\u00a0 If she suggests that another daughter of the family who is trained in etiquette enters the palace in the second daughter's stead, it is likely that this would be agreed to.\\\"\n\nThe king was an intelligent man, and Military Adviser Yu had been with him for many years.\u00a0 Consequently, he knew exactly what his friend was hinting at.\n\\\"You are suggesting that we replace this other daughter with one of our own people as a spy.\\\"\n\\\"Your Majesty is quick to grasp the situation.\\\"\n\\\"But who?\u00a0 You say that the situation there is urgent, but where could we find a suitable young woman at such short notice to enter the palace and not be discovered?\u00a0 She must have knowledge of palace etiquette, be able to speak the Han dialect, and still have sufficient martial arts skills that will both protect her and let her be an effective spy for Jin.\u00a0 It cannot be anyone who is already placed in Han.\u00a0 Their identities are established.\\\"\nThese were all good points, but Yu Long was well prepared.\u00a0 Still, what he had to say was sensitive, and so once again he relied on his relationship with the king to get his message across.\n\\\"Perhaps Your Majesty and I could...\\\" he tailed off, and King Hu\u00ecw\u00e9n immediately took his meaning.\n\\\"Yes, it requires further consideration.\u00a0 Everyone may leave.\u00a0 Military Adviser Yu, join me for a walk in the gardens.\\\"\nAway from curious eyes and ears, Yu Long continued. \n\\\"There is no one suitable in our military.\u00a0 There is only one person I can think of who is both loyal and qualified, but I am hesitant to suggest it.\\\"\nThe king closed his eyes and sighed heavily as the other man spoke.\u00a0 He knew exactly who his friend was referring to.\n\\\"Your Majesty, she is highly intelligent and capable, and her martial arts skills are the equal of any man I have ever encountered.\u00a0 She speaks all the dialects of Jin and Han fluently, and she grew up surrounded by palace staff, so she is best placed to imitate their behaviours.\\\"\nYu Long took the king's silence as a signal to carry on speaking.\n\\\"Moreover, she has never gone outside of the palace walls using her real identity, so no one in Han knows what she looks like.\u00a0 Also...\\\" he paused.\u00a0 \\\"There is the matter of her...special gift.\\\" \nHe stopped when the king looked at him sharply, but duty compelled him to continue. \n\\\"Your Majesty, you know me.\u00a0 You know I would never suggest this if there was any other option,\\\" he finished.\nThe king sighed a second time, even more heavily than the first. \n\\\"I know my friend.\u00a0 But you are talking about my only daughter.\u00a0 How could I risk my own flesh and blood on this mission?\\\"\n\\\"Your Majesty, you remember how the princess begged to learn martial arts from a young age.\u00a0 How she devoted herself to learning military matters, politics, literature - not because she had to but because she wanted to.\u00a0 I will admit that she has an adventurous spirit and can sometimes be a little impetuous, but her sense of justice and overall good judgment is unparalleled.\u00a0 But, more than anything, you know her desire to serve Jin and you.\\\" \nThe king, however, was undeterred.\n\\\"I know all this.\u00a0 Still, am I not allowed to be unreasonable when it comes to my own child?\u00a0 No, I will not give the order to send her!\\\" \nYu Long went to respond, but was stopped suddenly by the king's raised hand. \n\\\"Let me finish.\u00a0 I will not order it.\u00a0 I will ask her if she wishes to go.\u00a0 The choice will be entirely hers.\u00a0 And whatever her decision, that will be the end of it.\\\" \nKing Hu\u00ecw\u00e9n's tone was authoritative and his expression was set, but it could not hide the sadness in his eyes.\u00a0 He knew his daughter like he knew himself, and he was already certain what she would choose to do. \n\n\n\n"}

{"prompt": "This is the best story ever\n\nThe Interview: Chloe a gorgeous girl submits to get a job at Booth's a publishing house.\n\n#job, #sex, #hot, #love, #sexy, #porn, #submission, #erotica\n\nThe Interview\n\n Chapter 1", "completion": "\n\nChloe had a sense of trepidation about today's interview at Booth's, a well known but infamously private publishing house in London. She knew they were a good firm, but the job description was vague and she hadn't prepared.\nThe recruitment officer had contacted her anonymously, and had told her that she had been headhunted specifically by the MD of the company. The guy had said that she was the first person he'd ever known to even be invited to an interview. Chloe was pleased, and intrigued about this company. With a PA starting salary of \u00a3100k a year, plus bonuses, it was four times her current meagre wage -- she knew it had to be worth going for.\nShe dressed sharply, adorning her lean figure in a tight pencil skirt that hugged her ass and thighs perfectly. It had a fairly generous slit from her knee upwards that displayed her toned thigh when she moved. Obviously, the key to feeling good is wearing good underwear, so she slipped on silky black French knickers and a matching balconnette bra that pushed her breasts upwards into two beautiful mounds. Her long legs were modestly almost covered in sheer stockings, held up by suspenders.\nOn top, she covered up with a bright white shirt, leaving a few buttons undone so her gorgeous cleavage could be seen. Hell, it didn't hurt to be sexy at an interview, knowing her interviewer was very likely to be a man -- Booths was notorious for having a male-only employee base. Until now, she thought, hopefully.\nShe used a smart belt to enhance her tiny waist, and completed her outfit with some new shoes -- 4\\\" spiked heel stilettos. The look was professional, but sexy -- all of her curves shown off to just the right effect.\nBooth's had sent a car to pick her up, and Chloe was impressed as the elegant Bentley swung round in front of her house. Already off to a good start, she thought.\nAfter a short journey, she was dropped off outside the huge gates of the imposing ten storey office block. A security guard checked her interview request letter, then her picture, and then phoned up to Booth's for confirmation. Chloe wondered if these guys were secretly dealing arms, given the hassle it took for anyone to get inside the building.\nFinally, the gates were open and she strutted across the grounds to get to the building. The reception desk was at the far end of a grand square hallway, flanked with expensive looking sculptures, and of course, four more security guards. Weirdly, there was even a man on reception -- usually most firms hired someone just like Chloe (i.e. pretty) to do that kind of stuff. He asked her more security questions -- this was as bad as Customs.\nFifteen minutes later, she was finally allowed to go up. The interview was to be held in the private office of the MD on the top floor of the building, and one of the security guards escorted her to the lift. \\\"Good luck miss,\\\" he said \\\"I'm sure you'll do well.\\\" Chloe smiled, as the lift doors closed smoothly.\nUp on the tenth floor, she was greeted by John, Mr Hitchin's assistant. \\\"Welcome to Booths,\\\" he said \\\"Please follow me.\\\"\nShe walked behind John along a corridor with displays of wealth all around. Glamorous paintings, wood panelling and a carpet so thick it made Chloe want to sink her bare feet into it.\nJohn knocked gently on the heavy door to what was the office, and pushed it open gently. Inside, behind an enormous mahogany desk sat Mr Hitchin himself. He stood up as Chloe entered the room. \\\"Thank you John,\\\" he said \\\"I'll take it from here\\\".\nHitchin was well groomed, Chloe thought. Mid forties maybe, dark hair, good teeth and a large, imposing frame. She could see why poor, weedy looking John looked intimidated.\nShe took a seat on the other side of the desk, as he poured her, oddly, not tea or coffee, but a glass of champagne.\n\\\"We like to do things our way at Booths,\\\" he said as he handed it to her \\\"Do you mind?\\\"\n\\\"No sir,\\\" Chloe responded \\\"At least I won't have to worry about nerves.\\\"\nHe smiled at her, and she noticed his eyes lingering on her full breasts spilling out of her shirt.\n\\\"Well, Chloe, now I don't believe in stupid interview questions -- I'd prefer to see you in action\\\" he said, smiling. \\\"So the first part of this interview will be dictation. Open up the laptop just there and we'll get started.\\\"\nShe did as he said, and opened up the small laptop (personalised with Booths' logo) as he began to read from a small book he held out in front of him. She typed quickly, her delicate, French manicured fingers moving rapidly across the keyboard.\n\\\"Ok, that's enough\\\" he said after ten minutes. \\\"If you could just hand me what you've done as is, and I'll just check for any mistakes.\\\"\nHe took the computer from her and she saw him read what she had typed, and began to get nervous as he frowned every now and again, no doubt noticing a few spelling errors. This was pretty unfair, she thought -- she'd normally be able to spell check something!\n\\\"Chloe, there are a few errors that I'd like to go over with you,\\\" he said, looking serious \\\"Could you come round to this side of the desk please?\\\"\nAs she stood up, she noticed him looking at her cleavage again. She walked round to him and rested one hand on his desk to look at the small screen of the laptop. He pointed at the first paragraph, highlighting a spelling error.\n\\\"Chloe, this is pretty basic stuff. But I appreciate that you didn't get a chance to check it before you gave it to me. Have a look at the rest of the document and see if you can get rid of the other mistakes just now.\\\"\nShe began to read the document more closely, and carefully began to edit the various errors that were littered throughout.\n\\\"I wouldn't worry too much about all of this, you know,\\\" he said \\\"because there are going to be some other pretty important aspects to your role.\\\" As he said this, she felt him place his hand on her bottom, stroking her curves over her tight fitting skirt.\nShe felt surprised, yet she knew deep down this job offer had to have come with strings attached. No other PA job with her level of experience would ever have paid \u00a3100k with, and she recalled reading \\\"a generous bonus structure\\\".\n\\\"I'm willing to take on additional duties, sir\\\" Chloe said, still pretending to read the document. Hitchin's hand slid down and began to move up under her skirt. The skirt was tight, and his hand could only get so far up her. He moved his chair back a little, allowing space in between him and the desk.\n\\\"Stand in front of me, please.\\\" He ordered, and she did as she was told, moving across and standing upright, facing away from him.\nHe pushed her skirt up higher, and then more, revealing her suspenders, and then up until her knickers were exposed to him. His hand traced a path up the inside of her smooth thigh almost to the top, and then pulled away.\n\\\"I'd like you to turn around and take off your shirt and the skirt please.\\\" He barked.\nChloe turned around to face him, and slowly began to unbutton her shirt, and as she did so her magnificent tits became fully in view for him. He smiled as he gazed at her taut body in the silky, provocative underwear she was wearing, taking in the suspenders and the high heels as well.\n\\\"Now remove the bra and your panties.\\\"\nChloe knew this job had to be worth it. One shag and she'd have the job, and he was pretty attractive. She unclasped the buckle of her bra and unleashed her perfect tits, and as they were exposed to the air her nipples tightened into small pink buds. She stepped out of her panties and stood in her stockings and heels in front of him.\nHe reached forwards and stroked the outline of her breasts, and then tweaked her pert nipples quite roughly. She saw he was hard through his trousers already, and he looked big.\n\\\"Turn around and lean over the desk please\\\" he said, \\\"and open your legs.\\\"\nChloe did as instructed and felt her pussy open. She felt hot from being told what to do, having little control over her actions. He was domineering and powerful, and she didn't feel she could do otherwise.\nHe stroked her inside thigh again, and this time he reached the top of her thigh and cupped her pussy.\n\\\"You're a good girl,\\\" he said, leaning over her \\\"having a nice shaven pussy -- we like it like that here.\\\"\nShe felt herself get wet as he began to touch her , finding her clit and circling his fingers around it first gently, and then harder.\n\\\"You are not allowed to cum until I say so, Chloe\\\" he stated. She gasped, as despite this he continued to work her clit, and she felt her pussy become more and more wet.\nHe moved his hands and slowly pushed two fingers inside her pussy and then began to fill her with his fingers, inserting a third and thrusting them inside her repeatedly. She groaned, and he grabbed the back of her hair. \\\"I told you, Chloe -- you are not to cum until I say so -- quiet!\\\"\nShe silenced herself, and he carried on as he was before, pushing yet another finger up inside her. She felt so engrossed in what he was doing, and she began to enjoy him using her as he wanted. He removed his hands, and she heard him stand up from his huge leather chair and heard his zipper moving down, and a very soft thud as his trouser belt hit the floor.\nHe moved behind her and gave her a sharp slap on her ass. \\\"Now I'm going to fuck you properly, Chloe, and you are going to every fucking second of it.\\\" As he said that, he rammed his cock inside her pussy, and pushed himself deep inside her, and she felt her tight pussy stretched as his huge cock took her fully.\nHe began to fuck her hard, thrusting himself up sharply and filling her and she felt waves of excitement as she gave in to him. He pulled her hips even closer to take her deeply and she moaned with pleasure. As she did that, he held one hand over her mouth.\n\n\n\n"}

Reggie's eye contact seemed brazen, but he did it when Dave wasn't looking. Hopefully, this huge black man who towered over her husband wouldn't make an immediate decision. She needed to discuss this matter further with Dave. They could tell Reggie that someone else rented the room.\nReggie had experience with young, well-educated white women like Christy. He realized that he made her feel uncomfortable. A modest diamond engagement ring and wedding band sparkled together on her finger, catching his gaze.\nHe knew Christy's type. A privileged white girl raised in an upper-middle class family sheltering her from any interaction with men like himself. She likely professed racial equality but had never practiced it in her own bed.\nReggie had found their ad for a boarder on Craig's List. For a young couple without any children, this was far more house than they needed. He surmised that it was likely a greedy gamble they had made during the housing bubble, now leaving them in financial trouble.\nA shrewd businessman from drug dealings on the street, and a seasoned sexual predator that had never missed a chance at scoring a vulnerable white pussy, Reggie understood the fleeting nature of this opportunity, and he wasn't going to let it slip away. He reached inside his jacket and pulled out a thick stack of cash. \\\"I'll take the room. How much security deposit do you want?\\\"\nThey couldn't rent the room to this man. It wasn't his skin color that alarmed Christy. Something else about him made her hackles rise, and she wasn't sure why. Men stared at her often \u2014 she was used to it \u2014 but not like him. Standing with her arm entwined with her husband's, Christy tightly squeezed Dave's hand as a silent signal not to accept Reggie's offer.\nAll the money Reggie displayed mesmerized Dave who misinterpreted Christy's signal as an affirmation. \\\"Uh, $500 for a security deposit ought to be enough.\\\"\nA grin appeared on Reggie's face as he carefully pared away enough cash to cover the deposit plus an entire year's worth of rent. This na\u00efve kid hadn't even asked for his full name yet \u2014 although Reggie was prepared with fake identification \u2014 and apparently wasn't going to do a background check either. He handed the stack of bills to Dave.\nDave's face lit up like he just found a long-lost friend. Like Christy, his teens weren't far in his rearview mirror. He had anticipated perhaps getting a security deposit and first month's rent \u2014 not a full year's worth of payments in a lump sum like this. They needed this money badly with bills past due and foreclosure looming. The cash now in Dave's hand gave him a rush of euphoria, like winning a sweepstakes.\nChristy forced a smile Reggie recognized as insincere.\nReggie nodded at the money in Dave's grasp. \\\"I need a receipt saying I paid the entire year room and board plus security deposit. We can write-up a formal lease later.\\\"\n\\\"Of course,\\\" Dave replied with a quick and enthusiastic shake of Reggie's hand to finalize their deal. \\\"I'll be right back.\\\" Dave went to fetch a pen and paper to write the receipt, leaving Christy alone in the living room with Reggie.\nWhile Dave was gone, Reggie sneaked another look at Christy's tight ass and firm, young tits, peeling away her clothing with his eyes, as if she was luscious fruit to devour. He imagined how she looked beneath that modest dress she wore.\nChristy certainly was an attractive package. She stood about medium height with a petite build and perfect measurements that included a tight, flat stomach, nicely curved buttocks, and full breasts. She was exceptionally beautiful.\nThe 22-year-old college graduate and housewife took care of her figure through strict diet and daily exercise. Her model-like figure, combined with smooth, white skin, sparkling blue eyes, and silky, blond hair extending slightly past her shoulders, received gazes from many, who saw in her that unattainable girl of their dreams. Christy's heart belonged to her husband, Dave. He was the lucky man fortunate enough to have her.\nBut that didn't stop Reggie from undressing her with his dark eyes. His cock twitched as he thought about fucking this cute girl.\nReggie told them he was in school, but he was not dressed like your typical college student and wore an expensive sports jacket, silk slacks and Polo dress shirt that were all tailor fit and showed off a tall, muscular physique. Christy noticed impressive diamond rings on each of his hands. He looked more like an NFL linebacker than a college student to her.\n\\\"So, what are you studying?\\\" Christy nervously asked, attempting to break an awkward silence. Reggie also seemed a little old to still be in college as he had claimed. She guessed he was approaching 30-years-old, although it was sometimes difficult to tell with black men.\n\\\"African Studies,\\\" he responded.\nEarlier, Reggie had told them he was in college, but he hadn't set foot on a college campus in years, not since his younger days hustling drugs on the street. In his line of business, he moved up in rank without needing a formal education.\nHis quick reply with no elaboration seemed suspicious to Christy, but Dave suddenly returned smiling, a neatly written receipt and an extra key to their house in hand. \\\"Here you go, roommate.\\\"\nDave's smile was contagious, and Reggie seemed to catch it as he took his key and receipt from him. \\\"Okay, great. I'll be back later with my stuff and we can sign a lease.\\\"\nChristy felt relief as she watched Reggie leave. He had made her anxious, like she was standing on the roof of a skyscraper, looking over the edge without anything stopping her from falling.\n\\\"Look at all this money!\\\" Dave gleefully whispered holding up numerous hundred-dollar bills immediately after the door had closed and Reggie departed.\nChristy felt uneasy about having that strange black man move in with them. \\\"I don't know about this guy. Who carries around that much cash? Maybe we should check him out first, honey.\\\"\nChristy stood waiting for a reply. Dave's back was towards her as he counted the money on their kitchen table for a second time. He wasn't listening to her and didn't hear what she had said.\nPerhaps she was being overly cautious. She hadn't seen Dave this happy in a long time, since the rough economy had taken away their jobs and his pride, it seemed. The warehouse position Dave had found didn't replace his previous salary or pay all their bills, but this was enough cash to bring them current on their property taxes and avoid foreclosure.\n**************\nReggie returned later that evening and quietly unpacked in his new bedroom while Christy and Dave went to bed. He couldn't believe his luck finding such an unwary couple, and a young, beautiful white girl to pursue. When Reggie finished settling in, he turned off the light.\nHe sat quietly on the edge of his bed, imagining what Christy looked like beneath that dress she had been wearing. Was her pussy completely shaved or did she have a small, neatly groomed bush? With a figure like that she had to wear a bikini and was likely meticulous about her bikini line. Reggie was determined to find out. Access to a victim was the biggest hurdle, and Christy's na\u00efve husband had unwittingly helped him overcome it.\nAfter a few moments, Reggie's eyes adjusted to the darkness. Perhaps he could sneak a peek at her sexy little body while she and her husband slept. He silently made his way down the hall to Christy's and Dave's bedroom door, which they carelessly left ajar.\nBut they weren't asleep. The sound of lovemaking \u2014 the rhythmic squeak of bedsprings, the grunts and groans of two people lost in passion \u2014 grew louder as Reggie approached. He stood at the threshold to their room and peered through the sliver of an opening at two shadowy figures moving in concert in the moonlight.

His gigantic cock pushed against inadequate room in his gym shorts and sought release from its confinement. He wanted her badly.\nHis turn with her would come soon, he assured himself.

Soon they were winding through the lush landscaping and manicured lawns of the city's most exclusive area. The gates and walls got higher and the impressive homes got bigger the farther they traveled up Peacock Way. Finally they found 1591. The sun was setting as they turned through a magnificent iron gate onto a long paved driveway. Slowly they passed the immense grounds of the estate with giant trees, football- field-sized lawns, and almost every kind of flowers, hedges, and shrubbery imaginable.\nAt the end of the driveway was a truly astonishing house that almost looked like a hotel. The architecture was superb. Outdoor spotlights were already casting a soft glow to the giant structure, and a monstrous chandelier hung inside a mammoth archway that served as the entrance. A large fountain was positioned directly in front of the house, and there was a circular gravel drive around the fountain forming the parking area. Several expensive cars were already positioned there and a uniformed parking valet waited for Bob and Beth to stop in front of him. \\\"I've seen better. . .\\\" Bob joked, but the couple couldn't help being impressed by the residence.\nAfter giving the keys to the courteous attendant, Bob and his wife made their way up the long walkway to the gigantic front door. Before they could knock, the door swung open and a handsome young man wearing what looked to like a butler's uniform greeted them with a pleasant smile. \\\"Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.'W', may I have the password please?\\\"\nBeth and Bob were shocked that this stranger seemed to know them. . .at least by their initial. Bob stared straight into the man's deep blue eyes as if to size him up for a moment. \\\"Royal,\\\" he finally said firmly.\n\\\"Very good. . .thank you. Please follow me.\\\" The man led them into the house and down a long, dimly lit corridor. The Wests followed close behind -- gazing at the many fine and expensive furnishings and decor of the mansion. At last they came to a large room that was obviously the library. Each of the walls were stacked from the floor to the high ceiling with a myriad of books neatly arranged in tall oak shelves. Spread throughout the center of the room were groupings of overstuffed leather chairs and couches for lounging and reading. It was quite a comfortable and inviting room.\nSeveral couples were already mingling and chatting softly. A small staff of waiters served cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. Bob immediately scanned the gathering to see if he recognized anyone. All of the guests looked very similar in age; they all seemed to be in their mid-thirties, married, attractive, and well-off. There were three or four couples. . .then Bob suddenly spotted someone he knew; it was Dan -- a stockbroker friend he often played racquetball with. Dan saw him too and waved with a smile.\nBut before Bob and Beth could move over to their friend, the butler was in front of them again holding two jewelry boxes. \\\"A gift from your host. Please put these on and wear them throughout the evening. It is like an identification badge. One of the house rules asks guests not to refer to each other by their given names, but instead to use only initials. . .for privacy. I trust you will respect this simple request.\\\"\nAgain something strange and mysterious. Bob and Beth glanced at each other questioningly as they opened the boxes. Inside were golden medallions engraved with the initials of their first names: 'B'. The finely-crafted disks were attached to satin ribbons to hang around the neck. Bob's ribbon was purple and Beth's was pink. They put the pendants on and made their way toward Dan, or 'D' as his medallion identified him.\n\\\"Welcome, welcome!\\\" he exclaimed, smiling broadly. \\\"I'm so glad you could make it. I've been looking forward to this for a long time.\\\" D gave both of them a warm hug. \\\"You remember my wife, 'M'. . .\\\"\nThe couples exchanged greetings and hugs. \\\"What's this all about?\\\" Bob finally asked. \\\"Who's house is this?\\\"\n\\\"I'm afraid I can't tell you, buddy. . .\\\" D said, \\\"But you and your wife are in for one helluva great time tonight. You don't have any idea how hard it is to even be considered for one of these things. I had to pull some serious strings.\\\"\n\\\"Thanks, I guess. But damn. . .I have so many questions. Who are these people? Bob asked, still confused. \\\"And why is everybody so protective of their privacy? I mean, this only using people's initials thing is a little bizarre.\\\"\n\\\"Trust me,\\\" D chuckled. \\\"All your questions will be answered soon. In the meantime, just relax and enjoy yourselves. Get to know the other guests. Amazing place, huh? You have to admit this is probably not what you were expecting.\\\"\n\\\"We didn't know what to expect. . .\\\" Beth piped up. \\\"But I certainly agree with you. This place is amazing.\\\"\n\\\"You haven't seen anything yet! Enjoy yourselves. . .we'll keep an eye out for you.\\\" D grinned and his wife winked at Bob as the couple moved off to visit with some of the other guests.\nBob watched them go, secretly enjoying the way Dan's wife looked in her shiny gold dress. Truth be known, Bob had always considered Mandy to be a \\\"looker\\\"; she was taller than Beth, probably 5-7, with long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes that seemed to be teasing him whenever they spoke. M had a fantastic figure with big, full breasts and a shapely ass that undulated seductively in her tight gown as she moved away. Bob watched her go until Beth noticed where he was gazing and punched him playfully on the shoulder.\nThere were only two other couples in the room. Soon Bob and Beth met and visited briefly with both. 'S' was a big, ruggedly- handsome man who looked like a former football player. Rock- solid from head to toe, he shook Bob's hand firmly then surprised Beth by taking her small hand in his huge paw and kissing it lightly. His hazel eyes stared deep into hers as he smiled warmly. Beth liked his friendly, relaxed manner instantly and couldn't help fixing her gaze on him as he introduced his wife, 'T', a lovely, tall redhead. Bob and T chatted for a few minutes, while S turned his attention back to Beth.\n\\\"So, this is your first time here, huh? I'm so glad you came,\\\" S said smoothly; everything about him seemed to smile at Beth. She liked the way the soft tan-lines around his eyes wrinkled slightly when he laughed. There was a slight touch of grey at the sides of his full head of sandy-colored hair, but it just made him look that much more distinguished and attractive, Beth thought. He really was a good looking man.\n\\\"Yes, we are still kind of trying to figure out how we got here,\\\" she answered. \\\"It's all kind of mysterious, isn't it? Do you know the hosts?\\\"\nS laughed with delight. \\\"I'm not sure any of us really know each other very well. We've been to one or two of these parties, but, like you said. . .it's all rather mysterious. That's what makes it all so exciting. Don't you agree?\\\"\n\\\"I suppose, yes, I guess it is kind of exciting. I'm looking forward to finding out what else will happen,\\\" Beth admitted.\n\\\"So am I. . .\\\" said S softly, gazing at her again in a way that almost made her knees weak.\n\n\n\n"}

Well, more exactly, I'd gone through a serious depressed episode. I became sullen and paranoid, staying in bed for days and convincing myself that my husband had to be cheating on me. Ryan put up with my erratic behavior for a few weeks before forcing me to visit my therapist.\nGuilt and shame ate away at me when I finally shook off the suffocating weight of my damaged mental health. I twisted that angst into something creative, typing a full-length book in a little over a week. My efforts shocked my agent, who'd gone out on a limb to push the work through to a big-name publisher. I'd received a sizable advance, which had paid for a remodel of the garage--Ryan had wanted a man cave for years. I stole a drawing he'd kept hanging on the wall and gave it to the contractor, one who'd done a great deal of work for my husband in the past. I knew nothing about construction and couldn't tell if the workers did a good job, but Ryan had been ecstatic about the result.\nThe beef Wellington was resting and didn't look half bad. While the dish didn't challenge the professional images on the recipe website I'd referred to, the main course at least looked appealing on our dinner table. I slid the side dishes in the oven to finish and fairly ran upstairs to get ready for dinner.\nAfter a quick shower, I sprayed a hint of vanilla and brown sugar body spray across my body before pulling a simple black dress over my head. I wore no undergarments, just so I could feel a little naughty. My breasts were still firm enough not to sag without support. I refrained from adorning myself with jewelry in the hopes that I'd finally be brave enough to tell Ryan about the kind of sex I really wanted--the dress I was willing to sacrifice, my jewelry had all come from my husband and every piece meant something to me.\nMy dark, twisted fantasies had inspired my creative works. Works helped me carve out a reputation in the erotic fiction community. Ryan knew I wrote novels, but I shied away from telling him the pen name I used when writing my fantasy sex tales.\nTonight. Maybe tonight I would share my work with him. An intimate dinner on the most romantic holiday of the year should loosen my tongue. And hopefully his.\nOnce I was prepared, I messaged Ryan on his cell phone. He stalked through the back door only moments later, wearing a pair of black slacks and a silver button-down shirt, open at the throat and sleeves rolled up on his forearms. He resisted my attempts to rut with him, insisting that he was starving.\nStarving. Right. I was starving as well, but my needs didn't include fancy food.\nWe ate. We flirted over dancing candle flames and too many glasses of wine. Gradually, Ryan's teasing became more physical and he pulled me away from the table.\n\\\"My turn,\\\" he said as he blew out the candles on the dinner table. \\\"Come with me love.\\\"\nI followed him into the cold night, drunk enough that the freezing stones of the walkway didn't hurt my bare feet. A moment after we stepped into the darkness, we reached the door of the garage. Ryan pulled me inside, kissing me harshly on the lips.\nI gasped and stepped back, stunned by his unusual aggression. He grinned and pulled me closer, nuzzling the side of my neck.\n\\\"You trust me?\\\"\nA laugh escaped my lips, quickly turning into a moan as Ryan gently bit my neck.\n\\\"Yes,\\\" I eventually managed.\nRyan slipped behind me, covering my eyes with a silky blindfold. Wordless, my husband led me through the unfamiliar room. He carefully guided me, steering my body with gentle pressure on my shoulders until we stopped. Ryan's hands slid along my body, slowly pulling my dress over my head.\n\\\"Beautiful,\\\" he whispered in my ear. I felt the warmth of his body as he pressed against my back. \\\"My lovely Samantha.\\\" He guided my body until I felt pressure at the backs of my knees. \\\"Sit my love, I won't let you fall.\\\"\nI did as he commanded, letting my alcohol-relaxed limbs hang loosely as Ryan manipulated them. Before I understood what was happening, he'd locked my body into a rigid device.\n\\\"Ryan? What . . . what the hell are you doing?\\\"\nHe chuckled and slid my confined legs apart. Next, he moved my bound arms until they were over my head. The entire device rotated backwards, leaving me in a nearly supine position with my legs wide apart.\nI shivered, though not from cold. The room was comfortably warm. No, my body liked confinement.\n\\\"Did you really think I wasn't curious about your writing, Samantha? Or should I say Sammi Waters?\\\"\nOh my God! A fiery wave of embarrassment tore through my body as my brain processed what Ryan had just told me.\n\\\"I . . . I . . . I didn't know how to tell you,\\\" I stammered.\nI yelped as Ryan's hot mouth found my left nipple and bit down. Hard. His fingers pinched the right nipple until I started bucking my hips.\n\\\"You should have told me you like it rough, baby,\\\" he said once he released my left nipple. \\\"I've been planning this for so long. Waiting until you worked up the courage to tell me that you want to be bound and controlled.\\\" Ryan bit my nipple again. \\\"I've never played like this, but your books were so descriptive. I have so many ideas.\\\"\nI gasped as his fingers trailed down my body, flicking over the wet heat between my legs.\nI heard movement somewhere off to the right, near my head. The sounds of a drawer opening. Rummaging. A masculine chuckle, so low and hot it nearly drove me mad. Soft footsteps approached.\nAfter long, torturous minutes, I felt something hard pressed against my mouth.\n\\\"Open up, love.\\\"\nI complied and immediately felt a solid, round object slide between my teeth. A strap pressed behind my head, tightening until it fit snuggly. A gag. Dear God, he gagged me! My hips started working back and forth against the soft cushions supporting them.\n\\\"You want a master, don't you, Samantha?\\\"\nI lay motionless for a few seconds, considering what Ryan was asking. Then, slowly, I nodded my head. I was naked, bound, and gagged. The boundaries of shyness had been torn away the moment my husband slid the blindfold over my eyes. My body reacted strongly and in the space of a single heartbeat, I was soaking wet.\nCold metal pressed against my right nipple, gradually squeezing until I cried out against the gag. More cold metal and pressure, against the left nipple this time. Footsteps moved away from me. More rummaging.\nSomething clicked then an insistent purring sound filled the room. Before I could draw in a breath, something hot and vibrating pressed against my clit. I screamed against the gag, wholly unprepared for the sudden intrusion. Fighting the restraints, I bucked my hips trying to escape the powerful stimulation.\nThe vibrations abruptly stopped. As I worked to control my breathing, a sharp slap of pain exploded across my clit. The sound of leather slapping against flesh filled the room. Another slap. More pain.\nMy orgasm surprised me. Pain exploded into overwhelming pleasure as I screamed against the gag in my mouth.\nThe vibrator suddenly pressed back against my clit, forcing a second painful orgasm from my trembling body.\nWarm fingers stroked my body, ran along my shaking limbs. I groaned as Ryan's hands worked along the sides of my breasts. He pulled the clip from my right nipple. Then the left. I grunted with each quick burst of discomfort.\n\\\"You like that, precious?\\\"\nI groaned, barely able to nod my head.\n\\\"This week will be amazing,\\\" Ryan said softly as he removed my blindfold. \\\"I think I'll like this domination thing, Samantha. But this wasn't initially what I'd planned for your Valentine's Day gift.\\\"\nHe moved to my side, fingers trailing along my torso as he teased my body. He reached my soaking pussy and let his digits tickle the sensitive flesh of my outer lips. Gradually, Ryan worked his fingers along my wet sex until he found that bundle of nerves. I jerked and grunted as his fingers traced erratic patterns around my clit. In moments, I was gasping and bucking my hips as another climax built in my core.\n\n\n\n"}

They were playing with a wiffle ball and bat. Do I have time? she thought as the pulsing down below continued. Making her decision, she hurried up to her bedroom, quickly closing the door and turning the lock. Suddenly, she felt so naughty. It was the middle of the morning.\nAs she passed the mirror on the back of the closet door she stopped. She was wearing a pair of baggy shorts and old shirt. A frown crossed her pretty face as she saw herself in a different light. She reached down and pulled her baggy shorts tight and turned so that her buttocks were facing the mirror. The shorts outlined her shapely rear, her panty line showing through. Maybe some new clothes would help! she thought as stared at the contours of her backside. Then she turned this way and that, bending slightly forward. She could feel her vagina continue to pulse with excitement. So Drew drools at this? she thought and a chill ran down her spine. On impulse, she pulled the seat of her shorts upward until the seam buried between her cheeks. \\\"Ohhh!\\\" she moaned when she felt the material touch her \\\"there\\\".\nShe bit her lip and she felt embarrassed as she looked at the drawer where she hid her pleasure devices. Making her decision, she rushed over and searched in the back, behind her underwear and various other \\\"toys,\\\" to find the vibrator she had bought from a mail order catalog. It was long and tapered toward the end with a battery control device. There were rounded ridges up and down the shaft. The commercial said it was ideal for anal pleasure. It was!\nMary Ellen found some lubricant and rushed over to the bed. Her hands were trembling as she stripped off her clothes. She climbed onto the bed and got onto her hands and knees. When she looked back at the closet mirror she gasped. Her buttocks were pointed straight at the mirror and her tiny anal hole was almost pulsing between her cheeks. It was so obscene... but so exciting. Quickly she lubed up the shaft of the clear blue vibrator. Without touching her vagina, she placed the tip on her anus. A moan escaped her lips as she began to press the shaft into her tight hole. She pushed her hips backward and the long shaft began to slip into her.\n\\\"Oh Jesus,\\\" she moaned as the ridges bumped past her tight sphincter. Suddenly, she began to tremble all over and a vision of her handsome neighbor came into her mind. He was kneeling on the bed behind her and he had his long penis in his hand. It was huge with a large red head that was shining with his sex juice. \\\"Do you want me to lube it?\\\" he asked breathlessly in her fantasy.\n\\\"No, just fuck my ass! Please!\\\"\nAnother groan escaped her lips as she pressed the vibrator deep into her anal canal. She pressed the button that made it squirm. Suddenly, she could feel it vibrating and twisting deep inside her. Her eyes closed tightly as she imagined Drew sliding his large penis into her virgin ass. \\\"Ohhhhh God,\\\" she moaned as chills ran up and down her spine. She began to pump the long vibrator in and out between her spread ass cheeks as she spread her legs even wider. The tips of her naked breasts rubbed on the cover making her nipples swell with pleasure and sent ripples though her body. Suddenly every muscle in her body went stiff as waves of pleasure began to consume her. It felt like she might pass out as the long tip of the vibrator brought on spasms deep inside her bowels. It started with little shock waves in her stomach like it always did. Then they began to grow in strength until her entire groin was electrified and her anus pulsed, squeezing the invading tool. Her vagina pulsed as well and juice dripped to the bed. She squeezed her anal muscles on the squirming vibrator and her mouth opened as if to scream. Instead of screaming though, she bit her lip hard-the kids could be in the house now. She gasped and shook as a strong climax consumed her.\n\u2028Finally, the satisfied woman fell exhaustedly to the bed. The long vibrator was still humming deep inside of her. As she lay gasping for breath, the twisting device began to slip out of her rear hole. Then, she heard the kids playing in the back yard and sighed contentedly. It was always the same when she had something up her rear. The climaxes were strong, almost earth shattering. However, in the after glow, like now, she always began to feel embarrassed and guilty. It was so against everything she had been taught. After all, she was a grown woman and for her to sneak into her room and do something like this... well, mothers didn't do that. Yet, she knew that she would do it again.\nMary Ellen had been very young when she first realized that she got a special thrill from her anus. It had happened almost by accident. She was masturbating with her fingers one time when she touched the tiny rear hole. It brought such a shock that she had to do it again. She felt nasty but still she pushed a finger inside. The feeling was so intense that she pulled it back out right away. She did it again, leaving it inside longer. Deep inside her, the muscles of her canal reacted, squeezing down onto the invading finger. At the same time, chills of pleasure like she had never known began to ripple through her. She began to move her finger in and out slowly, building speed until her hand was a blur. Within minutes her body began to tremble with an incredible climax. It went on for a long, long time until she collapsed onto the bed.\nOver time Mary Ellen experimented with various means of pleasuring herself vaginally, but none equaled the times when she used her finger... or something else on her anus. She often thought that she was sick and that maybe she should see someone. However, she knew that she would be far too embarrassed to ever admit to a stranger that she loved paying with her anus. She would have to admit all of her little secrets. Like the times that she would go to the mall with Dana and walk around with those little vibrating balls up her butt. (Dana would certainly be shocked if she knew.) Or, how she fantasized about her ass being violated by a room full of men in a wild bacchanalia of anal pleasure.\nThe guilt that started long ago was still with her today as she lay on her bed in the afterglow of a very satisfying orgasm.\n\n\n\n"}

It was actually a Yacht Club party. It was a different club than the one we belong to now.\nBeing that it was a Luau theme party, she was only wearing a small flowery wrap type mini skirt and a tube type top that left the bottom of her tummy bare. Her shoes were low heeled beach sandals with a strap between her toes. They were kind of a casual to dressy flip flop if you will with small straps. I will never forget how sexy she was. Rachelle is a cute little petite thing. She likes her toes brightly painted and loves sexy feet. Her hair was up at the beginning of the night with flowers in her hair. I admit that she had an, \\\"I'm fuckable\\\" look to her. Or an attitude look that said \\\"I'm sexy and I know it.\\\" Her skirt was short enough that her panties could be seen when she bent over good.\nThat club had a history of wild parties, but we weren't usually among the wild participants. I had heard of sexual escapades, but never planned to take part. There were two known swinging couples. People didn't say too much about them and their lifestyle, but both of the husbands confirmed it by trying to invite us to the lifestyle. Actually, those two have nothing to do with what happened with my wife.\nWe aren't regular heavy partiers, but I guess there are always exceptions. Rum drinks were flowing, and Rachelle was drinking Margaritas. She isn't used to drinking much tequila. We were all having an exceptional amount of fun. People's judgments and inhibitions were soon pretty loose.\nIt wasn't long before two of our friends who were also married were flirting with Rachelle. I don't dance much, but Rachelle loves dancing. I always dance to a few favorites which are mostly slow ones and that's about it for me. I never minded her dancing with other people who we know, because she likes it so much. Rachelle is a bubbly bundle of high energy. Ron and Gordon continued asking her to dance. As the party got crazier, they began both dancing with her at the same time.\nThey were soon clearly fooling around with her while dancing. We were also making excuses for her to bend over. We were all playing with her and she seemed turned on by the attention. Time went by with only flirting and teasing, but soon they were touching her when they were dancing. They kept holding her closer and trying to feel on her. She resisted a little at first, but soon she allowed more and kind of played along.\nLater in the evening when the only ones left had little sense of judgment, things continued to progress. Her short wrap skirt made things easy for the guys. Rachelle had danced with several people, but these two spent a lot of time with her. Finally they two were dancing with her at the same time. Then I noticed her panties were pulled down below the bottom of her little skirt. They took turns dancing close to her. Between the two of them, they succeeded at shielding the view, and I couldn't see exactly what was going on. I could see that their hands were under her skirt, and they obviously were fingering her. I saw her push them away a few times, but she didn't seem to mind that they kept doing it. I'm sure the other people who were dancing could see what they were doing to my little wife. I was so turned on that I really didn't mind.\nBefore I knew it, they had her sandwiched between them and lifted up with her feet off the pool deck. One guy facing her and one guy was behind her. Anyway, Gordon, who was facing her was pumping his hips into her. At first, I just thought they were kind of dirty dancing or whatever. His pants weren't down. But then I noticed them adjusting her like he was trying to get his dick in her. Rachelle struggled with a little resistance, but it also kind of looked like they were playing. I was a little concerned, but I really thought they would respect any real protest from her.\nI was caught off guard and stunned, but I was also so hard that it hurt. Then her mouth came open and her eyes were big. She began to wriggle and squirm trying to get down. As she squirmed, Ron just held her tighter like he was trying to hold her for Gordon to fuck her. He also pulled her top down exposing her bare tits. Gordon was trying to get her panties off, but they only went to her knees. Rachelle was trying to keep them on. Although I couldn't see that his dick was in her, It was clear that he was fucking my little wife right in front of our friends. Gordon had a hand full of her hair. The others were just now beginning to pay attention.\nGordon is over six feet, and Rachelle is only about Five two. She had been allowing so much all night. Therefore, I didn't know if she wanted down because it was hurting her or because she was ready to be fucked.\nRon continued to hold her up and push her against Gordon. It was also appeared that Gordon had more concentration on what he was doing to her. This didn't go on for long before he had a noticeable facial expression and seemed finished in her. Then I saw him flip the front of his waist band up, so I know he at least had his dick between her legs even if he wasn't able to fuck her.\nI couldn't see for sure while he was in her. Her legs weren't spread much with her panties on her thighs. I could clearly see that her panties were down and her skirt was up a little.\nWhen Gordon had finished in her, he loosened his hold on her. Rachelle started to try to get away but not with too much effort. Although she looked very concerned in the face, she actually had a slight smile.\nNext, Ron is doing the same thing from behind her while Gordon continued to help hold her up. He had her pretty tight. I think it was semi violating her with barely sufficient consent. The look on her face wasn't anger or real disapproval. It was more surprise and maybe a little fear because of surprise. I also think she liked it because her face also included a hint of pleasure and ecstasy.\nWhen Ron was doing it to her, he seemed even more determined. He had easier access from behind her. He had one hand on her breast and the other on her waist. I could clearly see glimpses of her butt checks from under her lifted skirt. Rachelle had managed to get her panties up some, but it was easy to see that her panties were still below her butt. I still could not see that he was in her, but the front of his elastic shorts were definitely down, and I caught a glimpse of his dick. He was bouncing her up and down and pumping his hips. Her eyes were big as saucers and her mouth wide open.\nRon obviously wanted to get further in her and was trying to adjust her so he could. Another couple came over. She took Rachelle's hand and the guy had his left hand on Rachelle's back and his right on her tummy. Ron was trying to bend her forward, and Rachelle's left foot made it to the floor. Her shoes had come off. Her right foot curled up behind her as they held her. Ron's dick was now visible nailing in and out of her. The third guy reached for her butt cheek trying to make it easier for Ron to fuck her. The girl put her face up close to Rachelle's face and cuddled her while Ron fucked her hard.\nWhen he finished in her, they let her go but kept her close between them for a minute. Her titties were out of her top. I saw her pull her panties back up then adjust her top.\nI don't think she was expecting what happened, but she didn't seem to be mad. Soon they came from the dance area, but she acted in a hurry and seemed really nervous for ten or fifteen minutes. When she settled down, she brought a Margarita for both of us.\nI told her what she did was hot and erotic. When I said it was in front of everyone, she didn't reply at first. She was uncomfortable, and I didn't want her to be. I didn't push it, but I did add, \\\"I could see them doing it to you.\\\"\nAll she said was, \\\"Really? Really? Well, they have been trying to get my panties off all night.\\\"\nI said, \\\"Good. It's okay. I hope they get them the rest of the way off,\\\" and left it at that hoping it would make her more comfortable.\nShe was still horny. I guess it was a wham bamb quickie for her, and she needs more than that so she could cum. She disappeared for a little while. When she did turn up, She seemed more subdued and disheveled.\n\n\n\n"}

Okay, he was a little wrinkly and a little smelly, which made it no fun going down on him, but on the bright side, I only had to go down on him once . . . maybe twice a week. He would even ask my opinion on things and pretty much let me take care of most of his assignments without a lot of interference.

He was a fresh graduate that was rumored to have taken a number of New Men's Study classes in order to rise quickly through the company chain of command.\nThe first thing he did was have me stand in front of him with my skirt raised for a panty check, threatening to spank me if they were damp. I promised him they were not, but he was resolute, piercing me with his smug gaze and fondling my pussy until he was satisfied that I was as dry as I claimed.\nI could feel my cheeks burning from embarrassment and I wanted to crawl under the desk and die. Sure, I understand the boss has the right privilege to check, but Mr. Schmidt never did. I mean, I did everything by the book. I dotted every 'I' and crossed every \\\"T\\\". Heck, even my skirt met the requirement of being 5 inches above my knee, but I made sure that they were not an inch shorter. And really, I had always went out of my way not to be like some of the, how should I say, 'looser' secretaries that I worked with.\nBut my humiliation didn't end there. With my dry pussy thoroughly mauled and my pride all but erased from my psyche- he ordered me to suck his cock.\nI knelt down in front of Mark, proceeded unzip his pants, and fished around for his cock. This I expected. I've worked for several men during my career as a secretary, and never had one yet who didn't want to test out the skills of his secretary . . .even my beloved old fuddy duddy Mr. Schmidt. But, what I didn't expect was the monster I freed from his pants. Dear God, it was the biggest I'd ever seen. I couldn't even close my fist around it. No way would I be able to fit it in my mouth! I licked along its mighty shaft, while jacking it off with my hand. I prayed that he would cum quickly, but it wasn't to be.\n\\\"Suck it slut,\\\" he said, grabbing the back of my head and forcing me to take it in my mouth. \\\"Don't just play with it.\\\"\nFrustrated tears welled in the corner of my eyes as I struggled to stretch my lips around his enormous head.\n\\\"Jesus, shit,\\\" he murmered. \\\"What are you useless? You act like you've never sucked a cock before.\\\"\nThe cocky shit had the nerve- to ridicule and analyze my performance! Kneeling there; choking and gagging on his cock, I looked at him with pure hatred in my eyes. Who did he think he was? He was just a temporary, and I had been doing the job by myself before he came along.\nThe bastard met my gaze, his eyes gleaming evilly. He chuckled, grabbed the back of my head, and thrust his hips twice, jamming his cock down my throat for a moment. I was choking and unable to breath. I could just see the headlines, secretary found dead in office after giving head.\nThankfully, he pulled out of my throat and began to thrust in and out with shallow strokes. It was still big enough that it banged against the back of my throat, but at least I could breathe. He tilted my chin up so that I was forced to meet his eyes. Like a dog trainer breaking in a new pup, he smiled as I glanced back down docilely, my hateful stare a distant memory. My first day with my new boss and there I was, on all fours between his legs, communicating my dependence the only way I could in this position, slobbering and sucking on his monstrous phallus.\n\\\"That's my girl,\\\" he said. \\\"At least you aren't untrainable.\\\"\nMy tears fell faster and my mouth grew tired and raw as I tried to pleasure him-tried to get him to cum so that he would stop his oral assault. Finally, he began to thrust faster. \\\"Oh God, here it comes!\\\" he gasped.\nFinally! With an aching jaw and chapped lips, I was never so glad as to feel hot cum shooting into my mouth. At last . . . it was over. . .\n06/26/13\nI could barely endure my first day working with my new boss, Mark Henderson, but was a walk in the park compared to today. Today, when I walked into the office, I could tell immediately something was up. Every secretary, PA, and receptionist stopped what they were doing and stared at me as I walked to my desk. I could almost hear their whispers, but I had no idea what they were saying, I only knew that it was about me. The moment I arrived at my desk, I knew what the commotion was about. Instead of my ergonomic chair beneath the desk, there was what could only be described as a saddle on wheels. In the center of the saddle a very real looking dildo pointed up luridly.\nMy purse fell to the floor, followed by my stomach and jaw. No, this was intolerable. Totally unacceptable.\n\\\"I see you've met your new trainer, Mr. Sybian,\\\" Mr. Henderson said from his office. \\\"Why don't you wheel him in here and I'll let you two get acquainted.\\\"\nIn a state of numb shock, I wheeled it into the office, careful to conceal it as best I could from the other office workers. Whatever Mr. Henderson had on his mind, well, he could just forget it. This was clearly over the line and I told him so.\n\\\"Mr. Henderson,\\\" I said. \\\"I don't know what you expect, but I mean, Mr. Schmidt is technically still m. . .\\\"\n\\\"Officially retired,\\\" Mark finished. \\\"You now work for me and since the employment contract you signed gives me the right to expect a friendly and motivated subordinate, it also gives me the right to train you as necessary.\n\\\"But I am friendly . . . I am motivated,\\\" I whined.\n\\\"And that is why I enrolled you in the Sybian training program,\\\" he continued as though I didn't speak. \\\"Meet Mr. Sybian, you new personal trainer.\\\"\n\\\"Look . . . there's no way . . . I - I quit,\\\" I stammered.\n\\\"Well, the non-competition clause in your employment contract states that you will not work at another business for a period of two years. Do you have two years of salary saved Megan?\\\"\n\\\"No sir, but . . .\\\"\n\\\"Can you hibernate? Or do you have someone who will support you?\\\"\n\\\"No sir, but. . .\\\"\n\\\"Then I suggest you say hello to Mr. Sybian.\\\"\nHe reduced me to tears. I hated President Ashcroft and his new law that made this possible, but most of all I hated Mr. Henderson.\n\\\"Say it,\\\" he repeated smugly.\n\\\"Hello, Mr. S-sybian,\\\" I stammered. I had been defeated at every turn. I had no choice.\n\\\"Now hand me your panties and I'll help you get mounted.\\\"\nI handed them to him and the little pervert held them to his nose and sniffed. Then he handed me a bottle of lube and told me to coat the dildo. I did as he bid, and then mounted the huge phallus. And it was huge, let me tell you. I had a hard time getting it all in, but Mr. Henderson moved behind my and pushed down on my shoulders.\n\\\"Ouch,\\\" I whimpered. \\\"It's too big.\\\"\n\\\"Oh, I'm sure that big girl cunt can handle it,\\\" he said, still pushing down.\n\n\n\n"}

You follow shortly behind. Once inside, I lock the door, and I go for what I want.\nWith my left hand I would rub you through your pants, feeling you grow harder by the minute. My right hand unbuckling your belt as fast as possible. I undo the button and the longest unzipping of my night. Finally the belt is unbuckled, and your gorgeous cock is released from its confinements.\nMy left hand is stroking your hard cock. I love the way it looks, the way it stands at attention and reacting to my every touch. I stroke it up and down, feeling the warmth exuding from it. In a steady grip I move my hand up and down the shaft, as a moan leaves your lips. I stop right under the head, then let my thumb gently move around the edge of the head. Slowly I work my thumb along the edge and then around the whole head. Wetting the thumb with a couple of droplets of your precum I keep letting it massage the sensitive head. You can feel the featherlight movements and the longer they go on, the more the whole sensation starts to concentrate on the head.\nThen you feel the fingers of my right hand grasp around the base of the shaft. As I tighten the grip on the base and start to pump up and down , the left hand continues to concentrate on the head. I can hear you moan the more I work on you. I love to hear you enjoying yourself.\nAs you start to get impatient you beg me to go down on you, motioning my head downwards. I stop the stroking and push you back against the wall. Tonight I'm in charge.\nMy left hand continues to work on making you as hard as possible. Your chest rises and falls faster as your breath gets heavier. With my tongue I trail down your torso before being faced with your beautiful cock. My lips embrace the head and in a swift motion I take you as deep as possible. I let your cock head tickle the back of my throat while my tongue dances around the shaft. Slowly I move up until just the head lies on my bottom lip. With the tip of my tongue I tickle it before taking you in again. I feel your cock on the back of my throat, the part that is hard to move past. With force I move my head down more and I can feel the head pop past there and moving farther down my eager throat. I move all the way out again, this time sucking on the tip of your cock. Then I take you yet again. Just the head this time. Sucking and with a steady tempo and pressure massaging it.\nAs I give you that blowjob you've been craving for, my right hand starts to play gently with your balls. I run a finger along your inner thighs up towards your crotch before letting two fingers caress that soft area behind your balls. As I feel your body tightening up I take all of you once again, keeping up the tempo with my warm mouth, as well as using my left hand while the right one continues to play with your balls. I know you're getting closer, your balls are tightening and your body's becoming more eager. You tense up and I can feel your cock twitching inside of my mouth as you cum. I've always loved that feeling, it gives a sense of power. When you try to pull out I won't let you. I want to feel you in my mouth a bit longer, throbbing and pulsing as my prize shoots down my throat, and I can taste a little in my mouth. Before letting go I swirl my tongue around your spent cock, extracting a loud groan from your lips as you're still very sensitive. When I finally let go I look up at you smiling. Then I swallow what's left after showing it to you in my mouth.\n\\\"Such a good little cock sucker.\\\" was the only thing he said to me when I was finished.\nHe pulled up his pants and walked out the door. I followed a few minutes later, but I'm pretty sure everyone knew what was going on...\n\n\n\n"}

Like really looked at me. He was so close, and I could feel his hands rising up to the tops of my arms, over my shoulders, and his fingers... Tenderly touched my neck. And his thumbs tilted my chin upward. I could smell him. And I closed my eyes.\n\nHis kiss was deep and soft. Something started to shake in the pit of my stomach. I leaned into his kiss, feeling every feeling. I let myself melt into him. I rose my hands up his chest and around his neck, and his then hands held me tightly around my waist.\n\nWe were like this for what seemed like a long time. Then his body started to detach from me, and then the kiss broke, and my breathing was strained. And his breathing was strained. He was looking at me again. His eyes then broke away from mine to my hands. He took my hand and started walking.\n\nHe walked slowly. I was on edge wanting to kiss him again, badly. We walked through his door, and he closed the door. He kissed the hand he was holding, and then kissed me once more. Just as soft, just as deep as before.\n\nI let him move us towards the bed, I was like putty in his hands, him positioning me in the center of my bed still kissing me. Live Wire. And fireworks.\n\nI was brave, and hot, and wanted him so badly.\n\nStill looking at him, I tugged at the sweater that his large muscular body slightly stretched out. He responded by slightly lifting his body from mine to allow me to remove it. Once I finally laid my eyes on his chest I kissed it. I felt his breathing shudder, I continued to kiss body. I traced my tongue up his neck and kissed my way under his jaw and landed on his lips again.\n\nHis responses pleased me. His kisses were more aggressive, and he pushed my shoulders back onto the bed. His hot mouth embracing the small amount of my exposed skin.\n\nMy mind was fuzzy. I suddenly felt another break in our kiss, and air between us. He was kneeling between my legs, looking at me again. I looked back in confusion, why did he stop? My breathing was now jagged.\n\n\\\"You're wearing too much.\\\" He then started to remove my shirt, careful not to touch my skin. And then my jeans. He unbuttoned them, and pulled them off by my ankles.\n\nI was in just in my pink bra and black panties. I let him look at me while I let my body show how much I lusted for him. My intense breathing, and my back arched, I lightly traced my torso with my fingertips pronouncing my goosebumps.\n\nHe started to to move. His mouth aimed straight towards my ear, I could hear his breath. His teeth grazed at my ear lobe, and down he went from there. He kissed my neck, and down my chest leaving cool pools of him one behind the other. He stopped for a moment, facing my body, his nose millimeters away from the skin between my breasts, contemplating.\n\n\\\"Don't stop.\\\" I said. After I said those words, his eyes met mine again, and his teeth started grazing at my nipple through my light bra. The sounds of my wincing voice slowed him down, but my hands intwined in his hair urged him to keep going. By now my breasts were both sticking out of my bra, tender and wrinkled. His hands wrapped around my body to reach for the hooks, and he released another part of me.\n\nHe continued to nibble and suck and kiss and massage my breasts. I knew he could make me explode just like that, given the sounds only he was getting out of me.\n\nI continued to wine and cry as his hot mouth and cool pools made their way down my ribs, and my belly button and my hips. I cried out my longing.\n\nHis tongue slowly and gently tasted the skin under the hem of my panties.\n\nHis hands positioned my knees, and I responded by holding them back towards my sides.\n\nHis tongue continued to lap at my inner thighs.\n\nBy now my clit was pulsing. His long fingers grazed at it through the thin fabric. I was sure he could feel the wet spot... His hand continues to my massage me while he teases me through the fabric with his tongue. Tasting me. He was trying to take his time with me. He was being so gentle, massaging my clit with his mouth, the soft fabric between them. The circular motions, the gentle sucking, his warm breath...\n\nI released my Knees, allowing my hips to arch for more. \\\"Agh,\\\" He stopped reluctantly. I felt him tugging at my panties from under me. I raised my legs vertically again, and he peeled the panties off very slowly. Once they were off I jumped on the opportunity to take the lead this time. I sat up to kiss him again, still gently, and foreword, until I could roll over him.\n\nWhile I kissed him I could fell his hands caressing my back. I sat on his lap, feeling the tough fabric of his jeans against me, and I started to grind. His hands then reached down to grab my ass and helped me rub against him. His lips were no longer on mine, they were on my beasts. My moaning turned to gasping has the tingles turned to shocks. It didn't take long for a small bit of euphoria to break through me. My hands grasped tightly at his back while I vibrated against him.\n\nI was in a beautiful distress, and he did not allow me to calm down completely before he rolled over me again. I was fading, but forced myself to tug at his jeans, now with a creamy wet spot at the crotch. I unbuttoned him and pulled at the crotch. I reached for his hips and pushed against the jeans and the boxers. He pulled the rest off as I eyed him. Fully erected up against his torso. His hands were on on either side of me.\n\nHe was staring at my naked body as I stared at his. I opened myself up to him, and gently cupped his penis from underneath. He responded by pulling his hips foreword while I directed him towards me.\n\nIt took a few minutes, he was so big and I was so tight. He was very slow and gentle with my while my body slowly accepted him. Slowly pulsing, he moaned as my pussy tightened around him. I felt every inch of enter me. By the last of it I Was penetrating him, taking rest of him again and again, back and forth.\n\nHis large hands held my knees back towards me. He kissed me once more.\n\n\\\"Give it to me, I can take you\\\" I told him. I don't want slow and gentle. He stifled a laugh against my neck, and I felt him slowly pulling out, deflating me. When barely the tip of his penis was inside me, he stopped. Then he shoved his whole member inside me all at once. It literally pushed the air out of me, making me a barely audible gasp. My eyes were wide with shock. \\\"Like that?\\\" He asked teasingly. I smiled lightly, my eyes beckoned for more.\n\nHe gripped at my hair, while he pounded me. It was exhilarating, I knew I was going to come soon. The fever of having him inside me and the sensation of his body on mine thrilled me.\n\n\\\"Yes, baby! Yeah!\\\" My voice was strained while I rubbed at my clit while his dick filled me again and again. A tight ball of butterflies growing in my gut.\n\n\\\"Uuuuughhhh!\\\" I felt a tear fall towards the edge of my hair. He slowed down and kissed my face. I felt the vibrating of my legs against his sides. I felt the shuddering that was my breath. I felt the tight ball that had exploded in my gut fade slowly.\n\nHe kissed my lips, my mouth was limp and open, momentarily incapable of thanking him. Taking advantage he sucked on my tongue... my bottom lip... my neck while I waited out my orgasm.\n\nBut I wanted control. I pushed his hips away. He tried to fight it, so I used all my strength to bottom him. I wanted him to see me again. I straddled my legs around him, and slid myself on him, placed my hands on his chest and started riding. The fever continued as I bounced my body, and by boobs bounced against each other.\n\nI saw the stress in his face. I knew he wasn't doing to last very long. I didn't want him to. I put my right hand around his neck mischievously, and tightened my pussy, and rode harder. Faster. His hands grabbed at my thighs, helping me.\n\nBy now there was a little vain popping on his temple. \\\"I want to swallow you, baby\\\". I've never felt so brave.\n\n\n\n"}

My present client is an obnoxious asshole, and today he did not disappoint. Angry that his wife was winning the case, poised to take half of his entire material wealth, he never fails to somehow place the blame on me. I constantly tell him that if he wanted an easy divorce he should have got a prenup. Or better yet, he should never have cheated on his wife. Of course he doesn't care, only concerned about his money. Fucker. Thankfully in my marriage, we can barely keep our hands off one another. Plus actual love, and cheating has never once crossed our minds.\nAs I pull into my driveway I let out a long sigh, and immediately loosen my tie. Next to my Audi R8 Spyder sits my wife's Lincoln MKZ. She's always preferred a more luxurious lifestyle. I'm a little more fast-lane, and am the subject of much teasing for it.\n\\\"So, Mr. Fast, how do you manage to last so long?\\\" she winks, followed by a quick flick of her tongue across her lips.\nThe memory of that day makes me chuckle under my breath. And it was a day to remember.\nAs you may have guessed I am a lawyer, not too shabby of one if I do say so myself. My wife is a well-known real estate agent, and her work can sometimes be trying. I sometimes end up on the receiving end of her pent up sarcasm and frustration, but it is a role I am more than willing to hold. Her satirical sense of humor is one of the many things I love about her.\nWhen I step through the front door I immediately feel it. Our sixth sense. Her desire calling out to me as clear as if she were saying my name. The door to the basement is open, and I can see the dim lighting from the top of the stairs. I take my time walking down them, removing my clothing piece by piece. When I reach the bottom I am left only in my shirt and pants. And she is waiting right where I expect her to be.\nHer slight, slim figure waits on the bed. Legs tucked underneath her, hands laying on her exposed thighs, eyes cast downward. The traditional submissive pose. She is allowed to perform this on the bed instead of the floor so that her legs are given some relief. I fling my jacket on the black leather couch in the middle of the room, positioned over a faux tiger skin rug, and stand before her.\nPlacing my thumb and forefinger underneath her chin I tilt her head back. Those beautiful emerald green eyes lock onto mine, already begging for release. I feel my cock twitch in response.\n\\\"How long have you been waiting?\\\"\nShe runs her tongue across her lips before answering, \\\"Too long without my master.\\\"\nIt is very rare that she is ever this eager, and it shocks me for a fraction of a second. This is definitely going to be fun.\n\\\"Lay down,\\\" I order, and she obeys immediately. Turning to reach into the bedside table I choose from a selection of handcuffs. Pulling out four pairs, 2 leopard print, 2 pink, I hear her moan her approval. They are soft, and gentle. Not quite as biting as other pairs that we own.\n\\\"Spread out.\\\"\nShe stretches her arms and legs wide, and soon I have restrained them with the cuffs. She is now spread before me, virtually immobilized. I gaze at her for a few seconds, then place a hand between her thighs. Her body jerks in response, and a smile spreads across my face. Removing my hand I feel her hips buck in an attempt to follow me. Pressing my lips to hers, I gently whisper, \\\"Patience, my dear.\\\" Her whimpers of frustration and desire continue, but she remains still. \\\"Good girl.\\\"\nOn the wall on the opposite side of the bed, there are shelves with various tools of pleasure. I trail my hand across them, the whips, a modified cat-o-nine tails(barbs removed) until I pause at the rods and canes. I hear her inhale deeply in excitement and anticipation, but that is not the mood I am in today.\nMoving down to a larger set of drawers I open the second to last one. The wand I remove is her favorite, and when I turn around, holding the weapon of mass pleasure in hand, her entire body tenses, almost jerking straight upward.\n\\\"Patience baby,\\\" I think to myself. \\\"The best is yet to come.\\\"\nPlacing the wand between her thighs I leave it off, and once again press my lips to hers. Gently holding her face, I use my thumb to caress her cheek, as our tongues invade and explore each other's mouths. My other hand moves down to her breast, cupping and squeezing with vigor. I gently pinch each nipple, pulling and teasing them. Before long they are hard, and jut out profusely. Her breathing has increased in pace, and she fidgets almost uncontrollably. I move my hand farther down her body...and flip the switch.\nHer moan is long and loud. It comes from deep within her, and forces her mouth open. Her body strains against her bonds, wrestling to escape, the immense tortuous pleasure taking over her senses. Her heavy breaths resemble wind tunnels, her whimpers and screams carry the weight of a thousand voices, all pleading for release.\nI watch from the side of the bed, the whole scene making my blood rush downward, in preparation of what is soon to come. One final touch is all that is needed. I pull a set of nipple clamps out of the dresser and without hesitation they are clamped firmly on her breasts. She screams in ecstasy. She has always been loud in bed, different from most women in that regard I suppose. It makes me relieved that we decided to put soundproofing in this room when we bought the house. Her swearing is enough to make a sailor cry.\nFinally her cries of, \\\"Fuck me! Please pound my pussy! Get the fuck over here!\\\" prove too much for me to resist. My pants are thrown away and I rip the wand from between her legs, now coated in her juices. I ram myself inside of her, and begin pumping immediately. I am lifting her body off the bed, and I hear the bedframe creak and moan with every thrust, the wood straining against our performance.\n\\\"Fuck me! Fuck me harder! Harder! Fuuuuuuuuuuck meeeeeeeeeee!\\\"\nMy reply is part groan, part growl, resembling an animal more than a human being. She continues to goad me on.\n\\\"Fuck yeah! Oh yes baby. Right there, right there, right there! Fuck I love this cock ohhhh shiiiit!\\\"\nShe wants even more. I grab the chain connecting the nipple clamps, and without stopping my relentless pounding I pull, hard. Words vanish from her mouth abruptly, and her body strains upward. Mouth and eyes wide open, she convulses, shudders, shakes erratically. I feel her pussy clench around me in orgasm, and it's the final straw. I too orgasm, cuming violently and straining her body even harder against its bonds.\nWaves of orgasm course through us, the greatest pleasure known to man granting us its gift. As the last few pulses of our shared orgasm flow through our bodies, we fall back onto the bed.\nBefore I lay down I manage to use my last remaining strength to take the keys and release her. She wraps herself around me, embracing me with her whole body, as my cum leaks out of her to spread across our joined legs. I wrap my arms around her and return the embrace, stroking my fingers through her long, brown hair. We lay there wrapped in each other's arms for quite some time, each too weak to really do anything else. I place a kiss on her head, and she nestles her face closer to my chest.\n\\\"How was that for my Queen of Luxury?\\\" I whisper.\n\\\"Just what I needed Fastlane,\\\" she replies with a smile.\nI laugh, \\\"Ha! That was quicker than usual though I must admit.\\\"\n\\\"Mmmm. Are you complaining?\\\"\n\\\"Not in a million years.\\\"\n\\\"Good.\\\"\nWe squeeze each other tightly, and before long we've fallen asleep in each other's arms. There's no place I would rather be.\n\n"}
